# Intelligence Artifacts (HexDDD integration)

Location: `docs/plans/hexddd_integration/intelligence/`

## Purpose

This directory contains draft intelligence artifacts for PHASE-000 (Pre-Implementation Intelligence Gathering). Each file is a scaffold with next-steps that require MCP/Nx/GitHub/Exa queries to fully populate.

## How to proceed

1. Run `nx_workspace`, `nx_generators`, and `nx_project_details` (Nx MCP) to fill `REPOSITORY_CONTEXT.md` and `MECE_VALIDATION.md`.
2. Run `context7` and `microsoft-docs` lookups to fill `DOCUMENTATION_BASELINE.md`.
3. Run `exa` and GitHub code searches to populate `PATTERN_RESEARCH.md`.
4. Run `vibe-check` to fill `VIBE_CHECK_OUTCOMES.md` and record confidence levels.
5. Store high-level summary items into the memory tool (if available).

## Contact

Once populated, notify phase owner and update `PHASE-000-PRE_PLAN_INTELLIGENCE.md` with GREEN/COMPLETE status and links to populated artifacts.
