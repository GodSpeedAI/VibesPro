# MEMORY_RECALL

Status: draft
Date: 2025-11-05

## Summary

This file will capture memory-based findings relevant to HexDDD integration: past architectural decisions, known generator failures, unit-of-work (UoW)/EventBus patterns, Supabase type generation learnings, and generator idempotency notes.

## Current content (placeholders)

-   Memory queries to run (MCP memory tool):
    -   "hexagonal architecture DDD patterns HexDDD VibesPro"
    -   "Nx generator idempotency testing strategies"
    -   "Unit of Work EventBus implementation patterns"
    -   "Supabase type generation workflows"
    -   "React framework universal generator patterns"

## Next steps (run with MCP memory tool)

1. Execute the memory search queries above and paste results here.
2. Extract recurring failures, patterns, and past mitigation actions.
3. Summarize 5 key takeaways and link to any PR/ADR references.

## Intended output

-   `key_takeaways` (top 5)
-   `references` (PR numbers, ADR ids, file paths)
-   `lessons_learned` short list for PHASE-001 planning

## Notes

This is intentionally left as a scaffold. Running the repo memory tool will populate this file with concrete historic references and citations.
