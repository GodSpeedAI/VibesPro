# PATTERN_RESEARCH

Status: draft
Date: 2025-11-05

## Scope

Collect concrete example patterns and reference implementations for:

-   Idempotent Nx generators
-   Unit of Work (UoW) + EventBus contract patterns across TypeScript and Python
-   Universal React generator strategies (Next, Remix, Expo)
-   Supabase type generation CI automation
-   Nx module boundary / tag enforcement patterns

## Planned searches (exa / GitHub)

-   "Nx generator idempotency patterns"
-   "Unit of Work EventBus TypeScript" and similar queries for Python
-   "React universal generator Next Remix Expo"
-   "Supabase gen types CI" or "supabase gen types workflow"

## Deliverables

-   3 recommended approaches per topic (trade-offs, complexity, sample repo links)
-   Short code snippets (where allowed) showing key ideas (read-before-write markers, AST transforms, deterministic file ordering)

## Next steps

Run Exa/GitHub searches and populate the table below with repo links and short notes.

## Placeholder table

| Topic                | Repo example (URL) | Pattern summary                    | Trade-offs         |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Idempotent generator | TODO               | Deterministic writes, marker files | Complexity: medium |

## Notes

This is scaffolding for pattern synthesis; populate with real URLs and snippets when live searches are executed.
