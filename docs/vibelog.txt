I'll add the bundle-context.sh script to the template and strike out step 1 in the report, then run the script once to verify it creates the context bundle.

```
Kicking off implementation with step 1 now: I’ll add the context bundling script, verify it’s safe and idempotent, and mark the step done in the plan.

## actions taken

- Added bundle-context.sh that:
  - Collects docs/specs and docs/steering Markdown if present, and also falls back to top-level `docs/{product,tech,structure}.md` if used.
  - Includes `architecture/calm/**` and `techstack.yaml`.
  - Outputs to `docs/ai_context_bundle/` (safe to run repeatedly).
- Updated vibecoder_integration_plan.md to strike out Step 1.

Files changed:
- bundle-context.sh — new, POSIX-sh safe context bundler.
- vibecoder_integration_plan.md — Step 1 struck out.

## try it

In your repo root for the generated project skeleton:
```zsh
bash scripts/bundle-context.sh
ls -la docs/ai_context_bundle | head
```

Expected: a new `docs/ai_context_bundle/` containing any available spec/steering markdown, `architecture/calm/**` (if present), and `techstack.yaml`.

Note: You can also specify a custom output directory:
```zsh
bash scripts/bundle-context.sh docs/custom_ai_bundle
```

## plan and progress

- ~~1) Add bundle-context.sh (with CALM + techstack, outputs to docs/ai_context_bundle/)~~
- 2) Append namespaced Justfile recipes (`ai:context:bundle`, `ai:tdd:*`, `ai:debug:*`, `ai:validate`, `ai:scaffold`)
- 3) Add TDD/debug chat modes in `.github/chatmodes/`
- 4) Merge vibecoder prompt content into `.github/prompts/` (dedupe, prefix as needed)
- 5) Update copilot-instructions.md (Using AI workflows)
- 6) Extend tool_index.md (how to use mcp.json)

Want me to proceed with step 2 and wire the `just ai:context:bundle` and other recipes next?
