## AI Prompts

Prompts are pre-written queries designed to handle common, complex, or repetitive development tasks. They ensure consistency and leverage the full context of the repository. They are located in `.github/prompts/`.

- **`bootstrap-dev-platform.prompt.md`**: Guides the setup of the development platform and environment.
- **`change-feature.prompt.md`**: Assists in modifying an existing feature based on new requirements.
- **`create-react-component.prompt.md`**: Generates boilerplate for a new React component following project conventions.
- **`generate-ai-docs.prompt.md`**: Creates documentation for AI-related components and workflows.
- **`implement-feature.prompt.md`**: Guides the implementation of a new feature based on a specification document.
- **`load-spec-items.prompt.md`**: Helps load and process items from a specification document.
- **`performance-analysis.prompt.md`**: Initiates a performance analysis of the application code.
- **`security-review.prompt.md`**: Starts a security review of the codebase.
- **`spec-housekeeping.prompt.md`**: Assists with cleaning up, organizing, and maintaining specification documents.
- **`sync-techstack.prompt.md`**: Helps synchronize the project configuration based on `techstack.yaml`.
- **`test-hardening.prompt.md`**: Guides the process of improving the robustness and coverage of tests.
- **`traceability-matrix.prompt.md`**: Creates or updates a traceability matrix linking specs to code and tests.
- **`transcript-to-devspec.prompt.md`**: Converts a meeting or discussion transcript into a formal development specification.

- **`senior-frontend-engineer.chatmode.md`**: Simulates a senior frontend engineer for UI/UX and implementation discussions.
- **`spec-driven-lean.chatmode.md`**: Focuses on a lean, efficient approach to specification-driven development.
- **`spec-driven.chatmode.md`**: Focuses on the principles and practices of specification-driven development.
- **`system-architect.chatmode.md`**: Provides a high-level, systemic view of the project's architecture.
- **`target-audience.chatmode.md`**: Helps define and analyze the project's target audience.
- **`target-platforms.chatmode.md`**: Assists in defining and planning for target platforms (e.g., web, mobile).
