# AI Guidance Fabric TDD Implementation Plan

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed (Phases 1‚Äì4 implemented)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-14

---

## Overview

This plan drives the TDD execution for the "AI guidance fabric" defined in DEV-ADR-018 and DEV-PRD-018. The goal is to iteratively deliver temporal pattern recommendations, performance advisories, and context scoring improvements with verifiable tests at each phase. All work must follow the Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor cycle, with traceability to telemetry governance requirements. Each phase also records:

- **CI Workflow alignment:** steps required to keep GitHub Actions and Nx tasks green (`ai-guidance.yml`, `just test-ai-guidance`).
- **S.W.O.R.D skill coverage:** confirmation that Safety, Workflow Observability, Reliability, and Developer experience guardrails are satisfied before exit.

---

## Phase 1: Temporal pattern mining foundation ‚úÖ Completed

**Specs**: DEV-ADR-018, DEV-PRD-018, DEV-SDS-021 (to be authored)
**Focus**: Extend `ArchitecturalPatternRecognizer` to mine temporal DB snapshots and emit recommendation artifacts.

### Requirements
- Snapshot historical ADRs, work summaries, and success metrics from redb.
- Generate `pattern_recommendation` records with confidence, provenance, and temporal metadata.
- Provide CLI smoke command (`just ai-advice --dry-run`) that surfaces mock recommendations for verification.

### Test Plan (Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor)
- üî¥ `tests/temporal/test_pattern_recommendations.py` fails because `pattern_recommendation` table and exporter do not exist.
- üü¢ Implement ingestion, clustering, and persistence modules; rerun tests until green.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Extract shared utilities for vectorization/confidence scoring; ensure lint + type checks clean.

### CI Workflow Alignment
- Add temporal project to `nx.json` test graph (if missing) and ensure `nx run temporal:test` executes within 6 minutes locally and in CI.
- Register temporal tests inside `.github/workflows/ai-guidance.yml` (stage: `temporal-suite`).
- Update `just test-ai-guidance` to orchestrate `pytest -k pattern_recommendations`.

### S.W.O.R.D Skill Focus
- **Safety:** Verify retention/opt-out toggles redacted data before persistence.
- **Workflow Observability:** Emit OTLP spans for snapshot jobs and confirm they reach the test collector.
- **Reliability:** Introduce flaky-test sentinel that reruns the suite twice to guarantee determinism.
- **Developer Experience:** Document CLI dry-run usage within `docs/dev_prd.md` appendix.

### Exit Criteria
- All new Python unit tests pass locally and in CI.
- CLI smoke command outputs at least one high-confidence recommendation referencing source ADR.
- Temporal data retention guards verified via unit tests (`retention_days` respected).
- CI temporal stage green in `ai-guidance.yml`, and S.W.O.R.D checklist signed in PR description.

## Phase 2: Performance advisory heuristics ‚úÖ Completed

**Specs**: DEV-ADR-018, DEV-PRD-018, DEV-SDS-022 (to be authored)
**Focus**: Expand `PerformanceMonitor` to compute baseline deltas and publish advisories.

### Requirements
- Persist baseline latency metrics per workflow and compute rolling comparisons.
- Trigger `performance_advisory` artifacts when regressions exceed configured thresholds.
- Expose advisories via Node API consumed by CLI/chat surfaces.

### Test Plan (Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor)
- üî¥ `tests/perf/test_performance_advisories.spec.ts` fails (missing advisory generation).
- üü¢ Implement baseline storage, delta calculations, and advisory publishing; ensure test passes.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Add regression coverage for percentile thresholds and serialization edge cases.

### CI Workflow Alignment
- Add `performance-monitor` project to Nx test target inventory and include in `ai-guidance.yml` (stage: `performance-suite`).
- Extend `just test-ai-guidance` to invoke `pnpm exec nx run performance:test` and capture junit artifact.
- Configure CI cache key for telemetry fixtures to keep runtime under 8 minutes.

### S.W.O.R.D Skill Focus
- **Safety:** Enforce advisory payload scrubbing through unit tests (`PII` blocked).
- **Workflow Observability:** Ensure metrics/traces share correlation IDs logged via structured logging.
- **Reliability:** Add regression fixture locking baseline values with ¬±5% tolerance.
- **Developer Experience:** Provide README snippet for interpreting advisory suggestions inside the CLI.

### Exit Criteria
- Advisory tests pass with deterministic fixtures.
- Telemetry sanitization validated via `tests/security/test_temporal_opt_out.py` for opt-out flows.
- Metrics exported through OpenTelemetry verified using snapshot tests.
- CI performance stage green in `ai-guidance.yml`, with S.W.O.R.D acknowledgement attached to merge request template.

## Phase 3: Context scoring integration ‚úÖ Completed

**Specs**: DEV-ADR-018, DEV-PRD-018, DEV-SDS-021/022
**Focus**: Update `AIContextManager` to weight context sources using temporal success and confidence scores.

### Requirements
- Introduce weighting coefficients configurable via `ai_context.config.json`.
- Ensure bundle assembly respects token budget while prioritizing high-confidence assets.
- Surface rationale metadata (confidence, provenance) alongside each selected context snippet.

### Test Plan (Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor)
- üî¥ `tests/context/test_context_manager_scoring.spec.ts` fails (weights not applied).
- üü¢ Implement scoring adjustments and metadata propagation; confirm test passes.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactor scoring utilities for reuse and document coefficient tuning strategy.

### CI Workflow Alignment
- Register `context-manager` Nx target in pipeline (stage: `context-suite`).
- Ensure `just test-ai-guidance` sequences vitest run before CLI integration tests to reuse build artifacts.
- Add flaky-test watcher to rerun vitest on failure once with verbose logging.

### S.W.O.R.D Skill Focus
- **Safety:** Confirm opt-out metadata bypasses bundle scoring through dedicated test stub.
- **Workflow Observability:** Capture scoring decisions as structured events and assert ingestion by test collector.
- **Reliability:** Validate deterministic ordering of bundles using snapshot diffs.
- **Developer Experience:** Add CLI output examples illustrating provenance/rationale markup.

### Exit Criteria
- Context bundle generation tests pass with deterministic fixture sets.
- Token budget compliance validated via existing evaluation harness (DEV-SDS-009).
- Rationale metadata exposed in CLI output verified by integration test.
- CI context stage green in `ai-guidance.yml`, S.W.O.R.D sign-off logged.

## Phase 4: Feedback loop & delivery surfaces ‚úÖ Completed

**Specs**: DEV-ADR-018, DEV-PRD-018
**Focus**: Close the loop with developer feedback capture and multi-surface delivery (CLI, VS Code task, chat response adapters).

### Requirements
- Record accept/dismiss events from CLI/chat interactions and adjust confidence scores accordingly.
- Provide `just ai-advice` command with options to accept/dismiss suggestions.
- Ensure VS Code task + chat surfaces display confidence, provenance, and advisory text consistently.

### Test Plan (Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor)
- üî¥ `tests/cli/test_ai_advice_command.sh` fails because CLI command not implemented.
- üü¢ Implement CLI, chat adapters, and feedback persistence; tests pass.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Harden UX (color coding, markdown tables) and add regression coverage for opt-out flows.

### CI Workflow Alignment
- Add final stage `surfaces-suite` to `ai-guidance.yml` executing CLI + VS Code task smoke tests via container runner.
- Publish aggregated coverage report as workflow artifact and feed into quality gate action.
- Update `just test-ai-guidance` to accept `--ci` flag bundling all suites sequentially for reproducibility.

### S.W.O.R.D Skill Focus
- **Safety:** Ensure feedback opt-outs respect governance and are logged to compliance channel.
- **Workflow Observability:** Validate acceptance/dismiss events emit metrics consumed by dashboards.
- **Reliability:** Run chaos-mode test toggling network latency to observe resilience of feedback persistence.
- **Developer Experience:** Capture user-facing changelog summarizing new interactions.

### Exit Criteria
- CLI/VS Code integration tests pass with mocked data providers.
- Feedback events reflected in temporal DB and observable via snapshot test.
- Documentation updated (`docs/dev_prd.md`, `docs/dev_adr.md`) to reflect delivered surfaces.
- CI surfaces stage passes consecutively twice, and S.W.O.R.D checklist archived in release folder.

## Operational Notes

- Phases should ship in order; do not start Phase 3 until Phase 2 telemetry is validated.
- Each phase requires update to this document reflecting completion status and linking to work summaries.
- Add CI job `just test-ai-guidance` once Phase 2 lands to aggregate suites across languages, then promote `.github/workflows/ai-guidance.yml` to required status check with S.W.O.R.D rubric upload step.
- Maintain the tracker below to mark CI and S.W.O.R.D gates as ‚úÖ/‚ùå before requesting production rollout.
