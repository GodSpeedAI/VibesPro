# AI System Profile Architecture Specification

This document is a canonical specification for the AI System Profile Architecture (DEV-SDS-AI-PROFILE-001).

Full implementation notes and plans live under `docs/plans/AI-system` including the implementation plan and executive summary:

- [AI Profile Architecture Alignment Plan](../plans/AI-system/ai-profile-architecture-alignment.md)
- [Executive Summary](../plans/AI-system/EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md)

> The plan and specification are intentionally separated: the plan contains detailed steps, while this file captures the formal specification identifier and an overview.
