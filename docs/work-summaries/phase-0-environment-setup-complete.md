# Phase 0 Environment Setup Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 10, 2025
**Branch:** feature/devenv
**Status:** âœ… Complete

## Objective

Implement Phase 0 of the environment setup roadmap: establish test harness, fixtures, and Just targets to run environment tests locally and in CI.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Environment Test Harness (`tests/env/`)

Created a lightweight, portable test framework for validating environment setup:

**Files Created:**
- `tests/env/README.md` â€“ Documentation for the test harness
- `tests/env/helpers.sh` â€“ Reusable shell helpers (assertions, temp dirs)
- `tests/env/run.sh` â€“ Test discovery and execution runner
- `tests/env/.gitkeep` â€“ Ensures directory is tracked in git
- `tests/env/test_sanity.sh` â€“ Basic harness validation
- `tests/env/test_doctor.sh` â€“ Validates doctor script output
- `tests/env/test_harness.sh` â€“ Validates test discovery mechanism

**Key Features:**
- Automatic test discovery (finds `test_*.sh` files)
- Portable shell helpers for common assertions
- Fail-fast execution (stops on first error)
- Cross-platform temp directory creation
- No external dependencies (pure bash)

### 2. Environment Doctor Script

Created `scripts/doctor.sh` to provide quick environment health checks:

**What It Reports:**
- Current user and OS information
- Shell and PATH configuration (first 6 entries)
- Tool availability and versions (git, node, pnpm, python, rust, cargo, uv, etc.)

**Security Features:**
- Intentionally avoids printing environment variables
- Never echoes secrets or sensitive configuration
- Safe to run in any environment

### 3. Git Pre-commit Hook

Created `.githooks/pre-commit` to prevent secret leakage:

**Protection Against:**
- Committing plaintext `.env` or `.env.local` files
- Committing content with common secret patterns (API keys, tokens, passwords)

**Allows:**
- Encrypted secrets (`.secrets.env.sops`)
- Environment variable references
- Bypass with `git commit --no-verify` (with warning)

### 4. Just Task Integration

Modified `justfile` to add two new targets:

```make
test-env:
    @echo "ðŸ§ª Running environment tests..."
    @bash -eu tests/env/run.sh

doctor:
    @echo "ðŸ©º Running project doctor (no secrets will be shown)"
    @bash scripts/doctor.sh
```

**Note:** Used `test-env` instead of `test:env` because `:` is not valid in just recipe names.

### 5. Documentation

Created comprehensive `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md` covering:

- Environment setup overview and quick start
- Test harness structure and usage
- Writing new environment tests
- Doctor script functionality
- Secret management with git hooks
- Task orchestration with Just
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Roadmap for Phases 1-6

Updated `README.md` to reference the new environment documentation.

## Test Results

All Phase 0 tests pass successfully:

```bash
$ just test-env
ðŸ§ª Running environment tests...
ðŸ”Ž Running environment tests in tests/env
--- Running tests/env/test_doctor.sh ---
Testing doctor script...
Doctor test OK
--- Running tests/env/test_harness.sh ---
Testing harness discovery...
Harness discovery test OK
--- Running tests/env/test_sanity.sh ---
Running sanity checks...
Sanity OK
âœ… All env tests passed
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files (10 total)

**Test Infrastructure:**
- `tests/env/README.md`
- `tests/env/helpers.sh`
- `tests/env/run.sh`
- `tests/env/.gitkeep`
- `tests/env/test_sanity.sh`
- `tests/env/test_doctor.sh`
- `tests/env/test_harness.sh`

**Scripts:**
- `scripts/doctor.sh`

**Git Hooks:**
- `.githooks/pre-commit`

**Documentation:**
- `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`

### Modified Files (2 total)

- `justfile` â€“ Added `test-env` and `doctor` targets
- `README.md` â€“ Added environment documentation reference

## Usage Examples

### Run Environment Tests

```bash
just test-env
```

### Check Environment Health

```bash
just doctor
```

### Setup Git Hooks

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

### Write a New Environment Test

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
. tests/env/helpers.sh

echo "Testing my feature..."

assert_file_exists "path/to/config"
assert_cmd_succeeds "command --version"

echo "Feature test OK"
```

## Design Decisions

1. **Bash over POSIX sh**: Used bash for pipefail and shopt features; more portable in practice
2. **Minimal dependencies**: No npm/pip packages required for env tests
3. **Fail-fast execution**: Tests stop on first failure for quick feedback
4. **Security-first**: Doctor script designed to never leak secrets
5. **Portable helpers**: mktempdir works on both Linux and macOS
6. **Discovery-based**: Test runner auto-finds test files (extensible)

## Alignment with PRD/SDS

This implementation fulfills Phase 0 requirements from `docs/tmp/devenv.md`:

- âœ… **0.1** Added lightweight env test harness
- âœ… **0.2** Added test runner tasks (`just test-env`, `just doctor`)
- âœ… **0.3** Added pre-commit secret leak guard

Maps to specifications:
- **PRD-011..016** (Environment setup strategy)
- **DEV-SPEC-006** (CI posture and security)
- **DEV-SPEC-008** (Testing strategy)

## Next Steps (Phase 1+)

The foundation is complete. Next phases can now add:

### Phase 1 â€“ Devbox Integration
- Create `devbox.json`
- Add `tests/env/test_devbox.sh`
- Document devbox usage

### Phase 2 â€“ mise Runtime Management
- Create `.mise.toml`
- Add `tests/env/test_mise_versions.sh`
- Remove `.python-version` (mise becomes authoritative)

### Phase 3 â€“ SOPS Secrets
- Create `.sops.yaml` and `.secrets.env.sops`
- Add `tests/env/test_sops_local.sh`
- Document secret rotation

### Phase 4 â€“ Minimal CI
- Add `.github/workflows/env-check.yml`
- Add `tests/env/test_ci_minimal.sh`

### Phase 5 â€“ Volta Coexistence
- Add `tests/env/test_volta_mise_guard.sh`
- Document deprecation timeline

### Phase 6 â€“ Just Task Awareness
- Add `tests/env/test_just_tasks.sh`
- Ensure all tasks work in local + CI

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All env tests pass locally
- [x] `just test-env` executes successfully
- [x] `just doctor` reports environment health
- [x] Pre-commit hook prevents secret leakage
- [x] Documentation complete and accurate
- [x] README.md updated with references
- [x] No breaking changes to existing workflows
- [x] Tests are portable (bash, no external deps)
- [x] Security best practices followed

## Metrics

- **Lines of code added:** ~400
- **Files created:** 10
- **Files modified:** 2
- **Test coverage:** 3 environment tests (sanity, doctor, harness)
- **Time to run tests:** <1 second
- **Time to implement:** ~30 minutes

## Conclusion

Phase 0 is complete. The VibesPro project now has:

1. A robust, extensible environment test framework
2. Quick environment health diagnostics
3. Protection against accidental secret commits
4. Clear documentation for contributors
5. Foundation for Phases 1-6 implementation

The test harness is production-ready and can be extended with additional tests as environment complexity grows. All code follows security best practices and degrades gracefully when tools are unavailable.

**Ready to proceed to Phase 1: Devbox Integration.**
