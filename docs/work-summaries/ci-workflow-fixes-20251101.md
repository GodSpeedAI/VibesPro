# CI Workflow Fixes - Build Matrix

## Summary

Fixed critical issues in the `.github/workflows/build-matrix.yml` workflow that were causing CI failures.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Shell Script Syntax Error

**Problem**: Missing `fi` statement in the "Install just" step caused the shell script to fail.

**Location**: Line ~113 in build-matrix.yml

**Fix**: Added the missing `fi` to properly close the nested if statements:

```bash
if [ "${{ matrix.pkg_mgr }}" = "apt" ]; then
  set -euo pipefail
  if curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to /usr/local/bin; then
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/just
  else
    echo "just installer failed; attempting apt fallback"
    sudo apt-get update || true
    sudo apt-get install -y just || echo "could not install just; continuing without just"
  fi  # <-- This fi was missing
else
  brew install just || true
fi
```

### 2. Missing SOPS_AGE_KEY Environment Variable

**Problem**: The SOPS decryption steps referenced `$SOPS_AGE_KEY` but it wasn't exposed from GitHub secrets.

**Fix**: Added `SOPS_AGE_KEY: ${{ secrets.SOPS_AGE_KEY }}` to both:

-   `build-test` job environment variables (line ~79)
-   `release` job environment variables (line ~302)

This ensures that SOPS can properly decrypt `.secrets.env.sops` when the secret is configured.

### 3. Missing mise Trust Configuration

**Problem**: mise requires explicit trust for `.mise.toml` configuration files before it can read them.

**Fix**: Added `mise trust --yes .mise.toml` to:

-   "Install mise (for version introspection)" step in the `prepare` job (line ~35)
-   "Install mise" step in the `release` job (line ~332)

This allows mise to properly read and parse the `.mise.toml` file for version resolution.

## Testing

All local validation passes:

```bash
just ai-validate
```

Results:

-   ✅ Pre-commit hooks pass
-   ✅ Lint checks pass
-   ✅ Type checking passes
-   ✅ Unit tests pass
-   ✅ Node smoke tests pass
-   ✅ Logfire smoke validation passes
-   ✅ YAML validation passes

## Impact

These fixes address the following workflow failures:

1. Shell script execution errors in the just installation step
2. SOPS decryption failures when secrets are configured
3. mise configuration reading failures

The workflow should now:

-   Install just correctly on both Ubuntu and macOS
-   Properly decrypt secrets when SOPS_AGE_KEY is available
-   Correctly read mise configuration for version resolution
-   Continue gracefully when secrets are not available (e.g., in forks)

## Commit

```
fix(ci): fix build-matrix workflow shell syntax and SOPS configuration

- Fix missing 'fi' statement in 'Install just' step
- Add SOPS_AGE_KEY environment variable from secrets to both build-test and release jobs
- Add mise trust command to prepare and release jobs for .mise.toml configuration
- Ensure proper error handling in just installation fallback logic
```

## Follow-up

No immediate follow-up required. The workflow is now correctly configured and should pass CI checks.
