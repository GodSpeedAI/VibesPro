# Phase 6: Just Task Environment Awareness - COMPLETE ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Phase:** 6 of 6 (Environment Setup Roadmap - FINAL PHASE)
**Status:** Complete
**Spec Reference:** PRD-016 (Environment setup), SDS-042 (Task orchestration)

## Summary

Phase 6 validates and documents the Just task orchestration infrastructure for VibesPro, ensuring all tasks properly check for and use mise-managed runtimes. The implementation follows TDD methodology and provides comprehensive documentation for task environment requirements and best practices.

**Key Finding:** The justfile was already properly implemented with environment awareness! This phase primarily focused on validation and documentation.

## Objectives Met

✅ **Task Environment Validation**

- Created comprehensive test suite validating task environment awareness
- Verified all critical tasks exist and are properly defined
- Confirmed tasks check for tool availability before execution
- Validated graceful degradation when tools unavailable

✅ **Test Coverage**

- Created `tests/env/test_just_env_awareness.sh` following TDD methodology
- Test validates 15 different aspects of task environment integration
- Tests task existence, tool availability checks, safety practices
- All tests passing on first run (GREEN phase immediate)

✅ **Documentation**

- Added comprehensive "Just Task Environment Requirements" section to `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`
- Documented all task categories with runtime requirements
- Provided graceful degradation examples
- Included troubleshooting guide and best practices
- Added complete task reference tables

✅ **Environment Validation**

- All 9 environment tests passing
- Just task integration validated
- CI integration confirmed
- Local development workflow verified

## TDD Workflow

### RED Phase (Write Failing Test)

**File:** `tests/env/test_just_env_awareness.sh`

Created test that validates:

- justfile exists and is well-formed
- just command is available
- All critical tasks are defined
- Node tasks check for pnpm availability
- Python tasks check for uv availability
- Cargo tasks check for cargo availability
- Tasks gracefully degrade when tools unavailable
- Environment setup tasks properly ordered
- verify-node integration works
- Shell safety best practices followed

**Test approach:**

- Validates task existence using `just --summary`
- Checks task definitions for tool availability checks
- Verifies graceful degradation patterns
- Tests actual task execution (smoke tests)
- Validates integration with Phase 5 (verify-node)

**Initial Status:** Test passed immediately ✅ (GREEN phase started immediately)

### GREEN Phase (Verify Implementation)

**Existing Infrastructure Validated:**

All tasks were already properly implemented with environment awareness:

✅ **setup-node** - Uses pnpm (via mise Node)
✅ **setup-python** - Uses uv (via mise Python)
✅ **setup-tools** - Checks for copier availability
✅ **env-enter** - Checks for devbox before using
✅ **ai-validate** - Checks for pnpm, degrades gracefully
✅ **ai-scaffold** - Checks for pnpm before Nx generation
✅ **security-audit** - Checks for cargo before using
✅ **test-env** - Runs environment tests with bash
✅ **verify-node** - Phase 5 integration validated

**Graceful Degradation Examples Found:**

**ai-validate task:**

```makefile
ai-validate:
    @echo "🔍 Validating project..."
    @if command -v pnpm > /dev/null 2>&1; then \
        if [ -f package.json ] && grep -q '"lint"' package.json; then \
            echo "Running lint..."; \
            pnpm run lint || true; \
        else \
            echo "⚠️  No 'lint' script found in package.json. Skipping lint."; \
        fi; \
        # Additional checks...
    else \
        echo "⚠️  pnpm not found. Skipping validation."; \
        echo "Run 'just setup' to install dependencies."; \
    fi
```

**env-enter task:**

```makefile
env-enter:
    @echo "🎯 Entering Devbox environment..."
    @if command -v devbox >/dev/null 2>&1; then \
        devbox shell; \
    else \
        echo "❌ Devbox not installed"; \
        echo "   Install: curl -fsSL https://get.jetpack.io/devbox | bash"; \
        exit 1; \
    fi
```

**security-audit task:**

```makefile
security-audit:
    @echo "🔐 Running security audit..."
    @if command -v cargo > /dev/null 2>&1; then \
        cargo install cargo-audit --quiet 2>/dev/null || true; \
        cd libs/security && (cargo audit || echo "⚠️  Audit warnings found but continuing..."); \
    else \
        echo "❌ cargo not found. Please install Rust."; \
        exit 1; \
    fi
```

**No changes needed** - all tasks already follow best practices!

## Task Categories Validated

### Setup Tasks ✅

All setup tasks properly orchestrated:

```bash
$ just setup
# ✅ Runs setup-node, setup-python, setup-tools in order
# ✅ Each sub-task uses mise-managed tools
# ✅ Clear success messages
```

**setup-node:**

- Uses corepack enable (from mise Node)
- Runs pnpm install
- No environment check needed (assumes mise active)

**setup-python:**

- Uses uv sync --dev
- No environment check needed (assumes mise active)

**setup-tools:**

- Checks if copier installed
- Installs via uv tool install if missing
- Provides clear installation status

### Development Tasks ✅

**dev:**

```bash
$ just dev
# ✅ Uses Nx to start all development servers
# ✅ Parallel execution (--parallel=5)
# ✅ Assumes setup complete
```

**env-enter:**

```bash
$ just env-enter
# ✅ Checks for devbox availability
# ✅ Provides installation instructions if missing
# ✅ Enters Devbox shell if available
```

### Build Tasks ✅

**Auto-detection strategy:**

```bash
$ just build
# ✅ Detects nx.json → runs build-nx
# ✅ No nx.json → runs build-direct
# ✅ Can specify target: just build-target web:build
```

### Test Tasks ✅

**Layered test strategy:**

```bash
# All tests (auto-detect Nx)
$ just test
# ✅ Detects nx.json → uses Nx
# ✅ No Nx → runs direct tests

# Node tests
$ just test-node
# ✅ Uses pnpm test (Jest)

# Python tests
$ just test-python
# ✅ Uses uv run pytest

# Environment tests
$ just test-env
# ✅ Runs all 9 environment validation tests
# ✅ Validates infrastructure health
```

### AI Workflow Tasks ✅

**ai-validate:**

```bash
$ just ai-validate
# ✅ Checks for pnpm before running
# ✅ Runs lint if package.json has "lint" script
# ✅ Runs typecheck if package.json has "typecheck" script
# ✅ Runs Nx tests if Nx available
# ✅ Degrades gracefully with helpful warnings
```

**ai-scaffold:**

```bash
$ just ai-scaffold name=@nx/js:lib
# ✅ Checks for pnpm before running
# ✅ Provides usage help if no generator specified
# ✅ Clear error message if pnpm missing
```

**ai-context-bundle:**

```bash
$ just ai-context-bundle
# ✅ Runs bash script to bundle AI context
# ✅ Creates docs/ai_context_bundle/
# ✅ No dependencies needed
```

### Security Tasks ✅

**security-audit:**

```bash
$ just security-audit
# ✅ Checks for cargo before running
# ✅ Installs cargo-audit if needed
# ✅ Runs audit in libs/security
# ✅ Warnings don't block (|| true pattern)
```

**security-benchmark:**

```bash
$ just security-benchmark
# ✅ Checks for cargo
# ✅ Runs release build tests
# ✅ Measures performance overhead
```

## Graceful Degradation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Tool Availability Check

**Used by:** env-enter, ai-validate, ai-scaffold, security-audit

```makefile
@if command -v tool > /dev/null 2>&1; then \
    tool command; \
else \
    echo "❌ tool not found"; \
    echo "   Install via: ..."; \
    exit 1; \
fi
```

**Benefits:**

- Clear error messages
- Installation instructions provided
- Non-blocking for optional features

### Pattern 2: Feature Detection

**Used by:** build, test, ai-validate

```makefile
@if [ -f config.json ]; then \
    use-config; \
else \
    use-defaults; \
fi
```

**Benefits:**

- Adapts to project structure
- No hard requirements
- Flexible workflow support

### Pattern 3: Conditional Execution

**Used by:** ai-validate (most sophisticated example)

```makefile
@if command -v pnpm > /dev/null 2>&1; then \
    if [ -f package.json ] && grep -q '"lint"' package.json; then \
        pnpm run lint || true; \
    else \
        echo "⚠️  No lint script, skipping"; \
    fi; \
else \
    echo "⚠️  pnpm not found, skipping validation"; \
fi
```

**Benefits:**

- Multiple fallback levels
- Informative warnings
- Continues with partial execution

## Environment Integration Validation

### Phase 0 Integration ✅

- test_just_env_awareness.sh uses test harness from Phase 0
- Test discovery mechanism includes new test automatically
- Helper functions work correctly

### Phase 1 Integration ✅

- Devbox can provide just command
- env-enter task checks for devbox availability
- Seamless integration with Devbox workflow

### Phase 2 Integration ✅

- All tasks use mise-managed runtimes
- setup-node uses pnpm from mise Node
- setup-python uses uv from mise Python
- security tasks use cargo from mise Rust

### Phase 3 Integration ✅

- No direct integration (Just tasks don't handle secrets)
- SOPS decryption handled separately in CI

### Phase 4 Integration ✅

- CI workflows use Just tasks
- `just verify-node` in env-check.yml
- `just build` and `just test` available for CI
- Tasks work identically in local and CI environments

### Phase 5 Integration ✅

- verify-node task validated
- Just target exists and works
- Integration test in test_just_env_awareness.sh
- CI workflows use `just verify-node` correctly

## Best Practices Established

### For Task Development

1. **Always check tool availability**

   ```makefile
   @if command -v tool > /dev/null 2>&1; then
   ```

2. **Provide installation instructions**

   ```makefile
   else
       echo "❌ tool not found. Install: mise install tool"
   ```

3. **Degrade gracefully for optional features**

   ```makefile
   || echo "⚠️  Optional step failed, continuing..."
   ```

4. **Use meaningful status messages**
   ```makefile
   @echo "🔍 Validating project..."
   @echo "✅ Validation complete"
   ```

### For Task Usage

1. **Run setup first in new environments**

   ```bash
   just setup
   ```

2. **Validate environment before running tasks**

   ```bash
   just test-env
   just verify-node
   ```

3. **Let tasks handle missing tools**

   - Don't pre-check for tools manually
   - Tasks provide clear error messages
   - Follow installation instructions in output

4. **Use mise for runtime management**
   ```bash
   mise install     # Install all runtimes
   mise current     # Check active versions
   ```

## CI Integration Examples

### GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: Build and Test

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install mise
        uses: jdx/mise-action@v2

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: just setup

      - name: Verify environment
        run: |
          just verify-node
          just test-env

      - name: Build
        run: just build

      - name: Test
        run: just test
```

**Key points:**

- mise installed first
- `just setup` installs all dependencies
- Environment validated before build
- Same commands work locally and in CI

## Troubleshooting Scenarios Covered

### Scenario 1: "command not found" Errors

**Problem:** Task fails with "pnpm: command not found"

**Root Cause:** mise not installed or runtimes not activated

**Solution:**

```bash
# Install mise
curl https://mise.jdx.dev/install.sh | sh

# Install runtimes from .mise.toml
mise install

# Re-run setup
just setup
```

### Scenario 2: Task Skips Steps with Warnings

**Problem:** Task shows "⚠️ Nx not available" warnings

**Root Cause:** Optional dependencies not installed

**Solution:**

```bash
# This is expected - task degrades gracefully
# To enable skipped functionality:
just setup-node  # Installs Nx via pnpm
```

### Scenario 3: Incorrect Node Version Used

**Problem:** Task uses wrong Node version

**Root Cause:** mise not managing Node or Volta conflict

**Solution:**

```bash
# Verify mise configuration
mise current

# Check for Volta conflicts
just verify-node

# Fix version mismatch (see Phase 5 docs)
```

### Scenario 4: Task Works Locally but Fails in CI

**Problem:** Task succeeds locally but fails in CI

**Root Cause:** Environment differences

**Solution:**

```bash
# Test locally with same CI setup:
just test-env  # Should pass locally and CI

# Check CI logs for:
# - mise installation step
# - just setup completion
# - verify-node results
```
