# Typing Handoff Report: `temporal_db.py`

This report details the challenges encountered while attempting to add strict type annotations to `libs/prompt_optimizer/infrastructure/temporal_db.py`. Due to the dynamic nature of the code, particularly its reliance on `json.load` and a fallback storage mechanism, achieving 100% `mypy --strict` compliance proved to be exceptionally difficult.

## Key Challenges

1.  **Dynamic Database Backend**: The `_db` attribute was intended to be a placeholder for a `redb` instance, but the implementation falls back to using a file path (`str`). This dynamic typing makes it difficult for `mypy` to infer the correct type, leading to a cascade of `Any` type errors. I attempted to resolve this by adding assertions (`assert self._db is not None`), but this did not fully resolve the downstream errors.

2.  **`json.load` Returns `Any`**: The `json.load` function returns `Any`, which requires explicit casting to the correct `TypedDict`. While I was able to resolve many of these issues by casting to the `_PromptJSON` and `_OptimizationSessionJSON` `TypedDict`s, I was still left with some stubborn `Any` type errors.

3.  **`fromisoformat` Errors**: I encountered several errors related to `datetime.fromisoformat`, where `mypy` could not guarantee that the value being passed was a string. I attempted to resolve this with `type: ignore` comments, but this is not an ideal solution.

## Recommendation

I recommend a more thorough refactoring of this file to better support static typing. This could include:

-   **Explicitly typed data access layer**: Instead of a dynamic `_db` attribute, a more robust solution would be to create a simple data access layer with clearly defined methods for reading and writing JSON data.
-   **Data validation**: Instead of relying on `cast`, a more robust solution would be to use a library like `pydantic` to validate the JSON data at runtime.

I have reverted my changes to this file to avoid leaving it in a partially typed, error-prone state. All other Python files in the `libs/prompt_optimizer` directory have been successfully typed.
