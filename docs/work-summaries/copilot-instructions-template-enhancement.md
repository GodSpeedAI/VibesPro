# Copilot Instructions Template Enhancement

**Date**: 2025-01-19
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
**Related**: Generator-First Integration, Template Completeness

---

## Overview

Enhanced the template's `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to be comprehensive (matching the maintainer version's quality and structure) while supporting project-specific customization via an interactive flipped interaction prompt engineering technique.

## Problem Statement

The template's `copilot-instructions.md` was outdated and minimal compared to the maintainer version:

- **Maintainer version**: 748 lines, comprehensive coverage of all aspects (architecture, security, testing, workflows, etc.)
- **Template version**: ~80 lines, basic generic guidance
- **Gap**: Generated projects didn't receive the same quality of AI assistance as the maintainer project

Additionally, the template version was static‚Äîit couldn't adapt to different project types, tech stacks, or domain contexts.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Template with Customization Support

**File**: `templates/{{project_slug}}/.github/copilot-instructions.md`

Updated to match maintainer version's comprehensive structure with:

- üéØ **Project Overview** - Project type, goals, domain context (customizable)
- üèóÔ∏è **Architecture & Structure** - Architectural patterns, directory structure, tech stack (customizable)
- ü§ù **Development Partnership Model** - Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Validate workflow
- üìã **Coding Standards & Conventions** - Type safety, naming, organization patterns (customizable)
- üîí **Security Guidelines** - Critical security rules (non-negotiable)
- üß™ **Testing Strategy** - TDD, test types, running tests (customizable)
- üöÄ **Build & Deployment** - Setup, build commands, orchestration (customizable)
- ü§ñ **AI Workflows & Chat Modes** - Available modes and prompts
- üìñ **Domain Concepts** - Entities, business rules (highly customizable)
- üé® **Code Quality & Style** - Linting, formatting, review checklists (customizable)
- üí° **Problem-Solving** - Decision-making guidance
- üéØ **Quick Reference Card** - At-a-glance checklist

**Key Features**:

- Uses `[CUSTOMIZE: ...]` placeholders throughout for project-specific sections
- Includes example content to guide customization
- Preserves non-negotiable principles (generator-first, security-first)
- Maintains emojis and clear sectioning for readability
- References the customization workflow prominently

### 2. Flipped Interaction Prompt

**File**: `templates/{{project_slug}}/.github/prompts/customize.copilot-instructions.prompt.md`

A comprehensive prompt that implements the **intelligent flipped interaction** technique:

**Phase 1: Automatic Audit** (AI does this first)

- **AI reads project files** to auto-detect configuration
- Analyzes: `.copier-answers.yml`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `nx.json`, directory structure
- Detects: project type, tech stack, architecture, testing setup, deployment hints
- **Benefits**: Reduces repetitive questions, user doesn't re-state obvious info

**Phase 2: Targeted Questions** (AI asks only what it couldn't detect)

- **1-2 questions at a time** to avoid overwhelming the user
- **Progressive information gathering** across 3 priority levels
- **Smart questioning**: Only asks for critical gaps

**Priority Levels**:

1. **Critical** (If Not Auto-Detected)

   - Domain/business context (usually can't auto-detect from code)
   - Project type clarification (if ambiguous)

2. **Important** (Ask if Unknown)

   - Team size and experience level
   - Testing philosophy (can detect tools, not approach)
   - Deployment target (might be in copier answers)

3. **Optional** (Ask Only if Relevant)
   - Security/compliance requirements (HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS)
   - Performance priorities (real-time, high-throughput)
   - Domain-specific entities/concepts

**Audit Summary Template**:

```
üîç Project Audit Results:

‚úÖ Automatically Detected:
- Project Name: {from copier answers}
- Project Type: {inferred from apps/}
- Tech Stack: {from package.json/pyproject.toml}
- Architecture: {from copier answers or structure}
- Language: {TypeScript/JavaScript/Python/etc.}
- Framework: {Next.js/FastAPI/etc.}
- Testing: {Jest/Vitest/pytest/etc.}

‚ùì I still need to know:
1. {only unknown critical info}
2. {only unknown optional info}
```

**Output**: Updated `copilot-instructions.md` with customized content based on audit + answers.

### 3. Interactive Chat Mode

**File**: `templates/{{project_slug}}/.github/chatmodes/meta.customize-instructions.chatmode.md`

A conversational chat mode that provides an intelligent, audit-first UX:

**Phase 1: Silent Audit** (AI does automatically)

- Reads `.copier-answers.yml` for initial template choices
- Analyzes `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` for dependencies
- Inspects `nx.json` for workspace structure
- Scans directories (`apps/`, `libs/`, `tests/`)
- Reviews existing `copilot-instructions.md` for placeholders

**Phase 2: Present Audit Results**

- Shows what was auto-detected
- Lists only the gaps that need user input
- Provides clear summary before asking questions

**Phase 3: Conversation Flow**

1. **Core Questions** (only for critical gaps)

   - Domain/business context (can't auto-detect from code)
   - Architecture clarification (if ambiguous)

2. **Team & Testing** (if not obvious)

   - Team size and experience
   - Testing philosophy (TDD vs test-after)
   - Deployment target

3. **Optional Details** (ask permission first)

   - Security/compliance requirements
   - Performance constraints
   - Domain entities

4. **Confirmation** - Show what will be customized, ask for approval
5. **Execute Updates** - Apply changes to copilot-instructions.md

**Edge Case Handling**:

- User is unsure ‚Üí Provide examples, suggest defaults based on detected stack
- User gives vague answer ‚Üí Ask clarifying follow-up
- User wants to skip optional sections ‚Üí Allow gracefully
- Nothing to ask (all auto-detected) ‚Üí Confirm and apply updates

**Example Conversation**:

```
AI: üëã Hi! Let me analyze your project first...

    [silently reads files]

    üîç Project Audit Complete

    ‚úÖ Automatically Detected:
    - Project: MyAwesomeApp (Next.js 15 + TypeScript)
    - Architecture: Hexagonal (from copier answers)
    - Testing: Jest + React Testing Library
    - Nx Workspace: 2 apps, 3 libs

    ‚ùì I just need to know:

    **What business domain is this for?**
    (e.g., e-commerce, healthcare, SaaS platform, internal tools)

User: It's an e-commerce platform

AI: Perfect! E-commerce platform - got it.

    I see Jest is configured. **Are you doing strict TDD or test-after?**

User: We do TDD for business logic, test-after for UI components

AI: Great approach! TDD for business logic, test-after for UI.

    **Any specific compliance requirements?**
    (PCI-DSS for payments, GDPR, or skip this?)

User: PCI-DSS for payment processing

AI: ‚úÖ **Summary of Customizations:**

    - Domain: E-commerce platform
    - Testing: TDD for business logic, test-after for UI
    - Compliance: PCI-DSS (payment security)

    I'll update copilot-instructions.md with:
    - E-commerce domain concepts (Product, Order, Payment, etc.)
    - PCI-DSS security guidelines
    - TDD workflow for business logic

    **Should I apply these changes?** (yes/no)

User: yes

AI: ‚ú® Done! Updated .github/copilot-instructions.md

    [shows diff or summary of changes]
```

### 4. Just Recipe for Easy Invocation

**File**: `templates/{{project_slug}}/justfile.j2`

Added `just customize-instructions` command:

```bash
just customize-instructions
```

**What it does**:

- Prints friendly introduction
- Explains what will be customized
- Offers two options:
  1. Use the `meta.customize-instructions` chat mode in VS Code (recommended)
  2. Display the full prompt for copy-paste into AI chat

**Usage**:

```bash
# In generated project
cd my-generated-project
just customize-instructions

# Then in VS Code:
# 1. Open GitHub Copilot chat
# 2. Reference: @meta.customize-instructions
# 3. Follow conversational prompts
```

## Key Innovation: Audit-First Approach

**Problem Solved**: Traditional flipped interaction still asks many obvious questions.

**Our Solution**: AI audits project files BEFORE asking questions.

**What the Audit Detects**:

| Information               | Source                          | Detection Method                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Project name, description | `.copier-answers.yml`           | Parse YAML                      |
| Architecture style        | `.copier-answers.yml`           | Parse template choices          |
| Framework                 | `package.json` dependencies     | Detect Next.js, Remix, etc.     |
| Language                  | `package.json`, `tsconfig.json` | TypeScript vs JavaScript        |
| Testing tools             | `package.json` devDependencies  | Jest, Vitest, pytest            |
| Python framework          | `pyproject.toml`                | FastAPI, Django, Flask          |
| Workspace structure       | `nx.json`, `apps/`, `libs/`     | Count apps/libs, identify types |
| Deployment hints          | `.copier-answers.yml`, scripts  | Vercel, AWS, Docker             |

**What AI Still Needs to Ask**:

| Information             | Why Can't Auto-Detect                              | Priority  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Business domain         | Not in code/config                                 | Critical  |
| Testing philosophy      | Can detect tools, not approach (TDD vs test-after) | Important |
| Team size/experience    | Not in project files                               | Important |
| Compliance requirements | Security context not in code                       | Optional  |
| Performance priorities  | Not explicitly stated                              | Optional  |
| Domain entities         | Could infer but needs validation                   | Optional  |

**Impact**: Reduces questions from ~10 to ~2-5, saving developer time and improving UX.

## Technical Details

### Flipped Interaction Pattern

**Traditional prompt engineering:**

```
User: "Customize my copilot instructions. Here's my project: [wall of text]"
AI: "Here's your updated instructions..."
```

**Intelligent flipped interaction (with audit):**

```
User: "Customize my copilot instructions"

AI: [silently audits project files]

    üîç Audit complete!

    Detected: Next.js 15 + TypeScript, Hexagonal architecture, Jest testing

    Just need to know: What's the business domain?

User: "E-commerce"

AI: Got it. Any compliance needs? (PCI-DSS, GDPR, or skip?)

User: "PCI-DSS for payments"

AI: ‚úÖ Summary: E-commerce + PCI-DSS. Apply updates? (yes/no)

User: "yes"

AI: ‚ú® Done! [shows changes]
```

**Why intelligent flipped interaction is better**:

- **Audit-first reduces questions** - AI detects 70-80% of info automatically
- **Less cognitive load** - User only answers what AI couldn't figure out
- **No repetition** - User doesn't re-state info already in project files
- **AI guides conversation** - Natural flow, progressive disclosure
- **Better for unfamiliar users** - AI knows what questions to ask
- **Faster** - Fewer questions = quicker completion

### Customization Placeholders

Format: `[CUSTOMIZE: guidance]`

Examples:

- `[CUSTOMIZE: project type - web app, API, mobile app, etc.]`
- `[CUSTOMIZE: Your actual tech stack]`
- `[CUSTOMIZE: Add compliance requirements if applicable - HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS, GDPR]`

These are **intentionally visible** so users can:

- Manually edit if they prefer
- Know what needs customization
- Have guidance on what to include

The flipped interaction prompt **replaces** these placeholders with actual content.

### Non-Negotiable Sections

Some sections are **not customizable**:

1. **Generator-First Requirement** - Always enforced
2. **Security First** - Core principles apply to all projects
3. **Development Partnership Model** - Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Validate workflow
4. **Red Flags (STOP)** - Universal anti-patterns

These sections are included verbatim in all generated projects.

## Usage Workflow

### For Project Generators (Developers Using the Template)

1. **Generate Project**:

   ```bash
   copier copy gh:your-org/VibesPro my-new-project
   # ... answer template questions ...
   ```

2. **Customize Instructions**:

   ```bash
   cd my-new-project
   just customize-instructions
   ```

3. **Interactive Customization** (via chat mode):

   - In VS Code: Open GitHub Copilot chat
   - Type: `@meta.customize-instructions`
   - Answer 1-2 questions at a time
   - Review proposed changes
   - Confirm to apply

4. **Verify**:

   - Open `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
   - Check that placeholders are replaced
   - Verify project-specific content is accurate

5. **Use**:
   - GitHub Copilot now has deep project context
   - AI suggestions are project-aware
   - Team members benefit from enhanced guidance

### For Prompt-Based Customization (Alternative)

1. Generate project
2. Run `just customize-instructions` (displays full prompt)
3. Copy prompt to AI chat (GitHub Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
4. Answer questions in conversation
5. AI outputs updated instructions
6. Replace `.github/copilot-instructions.md` content
