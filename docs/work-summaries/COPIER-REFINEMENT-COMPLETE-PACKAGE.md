### 2. Comprehensive Documentation

| File                                              | Purpose                | Audience               |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `docs/QUICKSTART.md`                              | Getting started guide  | End users (beginners)  |
| `docs/workdocs/copier-questions-refinement.md`    | Technical analysis     | Maintainers/developers |
| `docs/workdocs/copier-before-after-comparison.md` | Specific improvements  | Reviewers/stakeholders |
| `docs/workdocs/copier-refinement-summary.md`      | Implementation summary | Project managers       |
| `docs/workdocs/copier-deployment-checklist.md`    | Deployment guide       | DevOps/maintainers     |

### 3. Quality Assurance

- ✅ No new dependencies
- ✅ No functionality removed
- ✅ All validators preserved
- ✅ All conditional logic intact
- ✅ Existing tests compatible

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### Language Refinement

Every question now includes:

1. **Plain English explanation** - No jargon
2. **Why it matters** - Context and purpose
3. **Concrete examples** - Good and bad examples
4. **Clear recommendations** - When to choose what
5. **Helpful defaults** - Safe starting points

### Organization

Questions grouped by user mental model:

```
📌 SECTION 1: Basic Project Information
   Simple questions everyone understands

📌 SECTION 2: What Does Your Project Do?
   Business purpose and context

📌 SECTION 3: Internal Naming
   Domain and technical naming

📌 SECTION 4: Technology Choices
   Pick what you know (with guidance!)

📌 SECTION 5: AI Features
   Optional but recommended enhancements

📌 SECTION 6: Code Structure (Advanced)
   Safe defaults provided

📌 SECTION 7: Security (Advanced)
   Optional enterprise features
```

### Example Transformation

**Before:**

```yaml
architecture_style:
  help: "Primary architecture pattern"
  choices: [hexagonal, layered, microservices]
```

**After:**

```yaml
architecture_style:
  help: |
    How should we organize your code? (Pick one)

    Don't worry if these sound technical - here's what they mean:

    - hexagonal: Clean separation between business logic and technical details (RECOMMENDED for most projects)
    - layered: Traditional approach with clear layers (database, business logic, UI)
    - microservices: Multiple small apps working together (for advanced/large projects)

    If unsure, choose "hexagonal" - it's the most flexible and maintainable.
  choices:
    Hexagonal (Recommended - clean and flexible): hexagonal
    Layered (Traditional approach): layered
    Microservices (Advanced - multiple services): microservices
```
