## üèóÔ∏è Key Patterns Established

### 1. Hexagonal Architecture Documentation

**Three-layer pattern thoroughly documented in libs/AGENT.md:**
- Domain layer (pure business logic, no dependencies)
- Application layer (use cases, ports/interfaces)
- Infrastructure layer (adapters, implementations)
- Clear dependency rules and examples

### 2. Testing by Architecture Layer

**Comprehensive testing strategy in tests/AGENT.md:**
- Domain: Pure unit tests, 100% coverage, no mocks
- Application: Unit tests with mocked ports, 90%+ coverage
- Infrastructure: Integration tests with real dependencies, 80%+ coverage
- Interface: E2E tests, 70%+ coverage

### 3. Generator-First Workflow

**Enforced in generators/AGENT.md:**
- ALWAYS check for generators before writing code
- Use `just ai-scaffold name=<generator>`
- Custom generator patterns for project conventions
- Integration with Nx MCP server tools

### 4. Template-Driven Generation

**Comprehensive Copier/Jinja2 guidance in templates/AGENT.md:**
- Full project generation workflow
- Jinja2 best practices (filters, conditionals, loops)
- Pre/post generation hooks in Python
- Template validation and testing

### 5. Security Integration

**Every AGENT.md includes security section:**
- tests/: Security testing priorities, threat modeling
- apps/: Input validation, authentication, rate limiting
- libs/: Domain invariants, authorization in use cases
- generators/: Input sanitization, path validation
- templates/: Variable escaping, secure defaults

---

## üîÑ Integration with Existing System

### Cross-Reference Network

**All Phase 2 files properly integrated:**
- Link to parent copilot-instructions.md
- Link to AGENT-MAP.md for navigation
- Link to relevant sibling contexts
- Reference modular instruction files
- Reference relevant prompts and chat modes

### Routing Tables

**Each file includes "Use When/Refer When" tables:**
- Clear guidance on when to use this context
- Explicit routing to other contexts when needed
- No overlap or ambiguity

### Practical Examples

**Every file includes 4+ real-world examples:**
- tests/: TDD workflow examples, test structures
- apps/: Controllers, DTOs, presenters, dependency injection
- libs/: Domain entities, value objects, use cases, repositories
- generators/: Generator implementation, schema, templates
- templates/: Jinja2 templates, hooks, validation

## üéì Key Decisions

### 1. Hexagonal Architecture as Primary Pattern

**Decision**: Document hexagonal architecture (Ports & Adapters) as the primary pattern in libs/AGENT.md.

**Rationale**: 
- Aligns with project's architectural vision
- Clear dependency rules prevent coupling
- Testability built-in (mock ports)
- Domain-Driven Design compatible

**Impact**: All library guidance follows this pattern consistently.

### 2. Testing Strategy by Layer

**Decision**: Define different testing approaches for each architecture layer.

**Rationale**:
- Domain layer: Pure logic deserves pure tests (no mocks, 100% coverage)
- Application layer: Use case orchestration needs mocked dependencies
- Infrastructure layer: Real dependencies when safe (databases, adapters)
- Interface layer: E2E tests for user-facing flows

**Impact**: Clear testing guidance prevents over/under-testing.

### 3. Generator-First Enforcement

**Decision**: Emphasize generator-first workflow in generators/AGENT.md with ALWAYS directive.

**Rationale**:
- Consistency across codebase
- Faster development
- Enforces architectural patterns
- Reduces boilerplate errors

**Impact**: AI will check for generators before writing code manually.

### 4. Template System Separation

**Decision**: Separate Nx generators (generators/) from Copier templates (templates/).

**Rationale**:
- Nx generators: Individual components within existing projects
- Copier templates: Full project initialization
- Different use cases, different tools
- Clear separation of concerns

**Impact**: Clear guidance on which tool to use when.

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Phase 3: Specialized Contexts (Planned)

**Pending AGENT.md files:**
1. **temporal_db/AGENT.md** - Rust-based learning database
2. **architecture/AGENT.md** - CALM docs and architectural diagrams
3. **ops/AGENT.md** - DevOps and deployment automation
4. **hooks/AGENT.md** - Pre/post generation hooks

**Estimated effort**: 3-4 files, ~2,500 lines

### Phase 4: Domain-Specific Sub-Contexts (Optional)

**Conditional on domain maturity:**
- `libs/{domain}/AGENT.md` for major bounded contexts
- Only create when domain is well-established
- Examples: `libs/orders/AGENT.md`, `libs/users/AGENT.md`

**Criteria for creation**:
- Domain has 5+ libraries
- Domain has unique patterns/conventions
- Team requests specific guidance

### Immediate Actions

1. **Update AGENT-MAP.md**: Add Phase 2 contexts to navigation tables
2. **Test navigation**: Verify all cross-references work
3. **Gather feedback**: Use system and collect issues
4. **Plan Phase 3**: Prioritize specialized contexts

**Reduced ambiguity:**
- Clear when to use TDD vs code-first
- Clear when to use Nx generators vs Copier templates
- Clear testing strategy by architecture layer
- Clear hexagonal architecture dependency rules

### For Developers

**Improved onboarding:**
- New developers can reference AGENT.md files
- Clear examples for common patterns
- Checklists guide workflows
- Quick reference sections for commands

**Consistency:**
- All code follows same architectural pattern
- Testing approach consistent by layer

## üéØ Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Consistent template structure**: Made Phase 2 faster than Phase 1
2. **Cross-reference network**: Navigation between contexts smooth
3. **Practical examples**: More valuable than abstract descriptions
4. **Security integration**: Keeps security top-of-mind

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Hexagonal architecture complexity**: Broke into three clear layers
2. **Testing strategy confusion**: Defined by layer with clear percentages
3. **Generator vs template distinction**: Clear separation and use cases

### Future Improvements

1. **Diagrams**: Consider adding mermaid diagrams for architecture flows
2. **Code samples**: Could expand examples with more edge cases
3. **Versioning**: Consider versioning AGENT.md files if patterns change significantly
