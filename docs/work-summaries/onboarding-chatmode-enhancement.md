# Onboarding Chatmode Enhancement

**Date**: 2025-01-19
**Enhancement**: Interactive walkthrough of available resources
**Related**: Copilot Instructions Template Enhancement

---

## Overview

Enhanced the onboarding chatmode to provide optional interactive walkthroughs of project resources (just recipes, chatmodes, prompts, tools) with clear guidance on when and why to use them.

## Problem Statement

The original onboarding chatmode was:

- Static list of links and quick tips
- No interactive exploration
- Limited guidance on when/why to use tools
- Overwhelming for new users (all info at once)
- No differentiation based on user experience level

## Solution: Interactive Guided Onboarding

### New Approach

**Two-Track System:**

1. **Quick Overview** - Fast start for experienced developers
2. **Interactive Walkthroughs** - Deep dives for those who want to learn

**User-Driven Exploration:**

- User chooses what to explore
- Progressive disclosure (start simple, go deep)
- Context-specific guidance (when/why to use each tool)

### Opening Experience

```
üëã Welcome to {{ project_name }}!

I'm here to help you get started. I can provide:

1. Quick Overview - Project structure, key resources, first steps
2. Interactive Walkthrough - Deep dive into:
