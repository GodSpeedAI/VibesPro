# Hybrid Context Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

Successfully implemented the hybrid approach for dynamic project context in Copilot instructions.

## Changes Made

### Phase 1: Maintainer Version

- ‚úÖ Already correct in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Describes VibesPro as a Copier-based project generator

### Phase 2: Copier Variables

**File: `copier.yml`**

Added three new variables:

```yaml
project_purpose:
  type: str
  help: "Brief description of what this application does (1-2 sentences)"
  default: "A hexagonal architecture application following domain-driven design principles"
  placeholder: "A SaaS platform for managing customer relationships with advanced analytics"

primary_domains:
  type: str
  help: "Comma-separated list of main bounded contexts"
  default: "core"
  placeholder: "user-management,billing,notifications"

tech_stack_summary:
  type: str
  help: "Key technologies beyond the framework selections (optional)"
  default: ""
  placeholder: "Redis for caching, Temporal for workflows, SendGrid for emails"
```

### Phase 3: Template Update

**File: `templates/{{project_slug}}/.github/copilot-instructions.md.j2`**

Updated the Codebase Context section with dynamic Jinja2 interpolation:

```jinja
## Codebase Context

**You are assisting with** {{ project_purpose }} This application follows
{{ architecture_style }} architecture with domain-driven design, organized
around bounded contexts: {{ primary_domains.replace(',', ', ') }}. The
technology stack includes {{ app_framework }} (frontend), {{ backend_framework }}
(backend), {{ database_type }} (database){% if tech_stack_summary %}, and
{{ tech_stack_summary }}{% endif %}.

> **üí° Tip**: To refine this description as your project evolves, use the
> project context refinement prompt:
> `@workspace /project.describe-context.prompt.md`
```

### Phase 4: Conversational Refinement Prompt

**File: `templates/{{project_slug}}/.github/prompts/project.describe-context.prompt.md`**

Created a comprehensive interview-style prompt that:

- Asks structured questions about business purpose, domains, tech stack, and architecture
- Provides examples and guidance
- Generates a 2-4 sentence description
- Updates `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with the new context

### Phase 5: Post-Generation Hook

**File: `hooks/post_gen.py`**

Added helpful message after project generation:

```python
print("üìù Optional: Refine Project Context for AI Copilot")
print("   As your project evolves, update the AI context description:")
print("   @workspace .github/prompts/project.describe-context.prompt.md")
print("   This helps Copilot understand your specific business domain.")
```

### Phase 6: Documentation

**File: `templates/{{project_slug}}/docs/how-to/refine-project-context.md`**

Created comprehensive documentation covering:

- Why context matters
- When to update
- Two methods (conversational vs. manual)
- Best practices
- Validation techniques
- Troubleshooting

## How It Works

### Initial Generation

When a user generates a project with Copier:

1. They're prompted for `project_purpose`, `primary_domains`, and `tech_stack_summary`
2. The template interpolates these values into `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
3. The generated project has a good baseline context description

### Post-Generation Refinement

As the project evolves:

1. Developer runs: `@workspace .github/prompts/project.describe-context.prompt.md`
2. AI asks structured questions about the current state
3. Developer provides updated information
4. AI generates new context description
5. Developer approves and AI updates the file

## Benefits

### For Project Maintainers

- ‚úÖ No manual template updates needed
- ‚úÖ Clear separation between generator and generated projects
- ‚úÖ Extensible through Copier's variable system

### For Generated Projects

- ‚úÖ Good default context at generation time
- ‚úÖ Easy refinement as project evolves
- ‚úÖ No dependency on template updates for context changes

### For Developers

- ‚úÖ Better AI suggestions that understand their domain
- ‚úÖ Reduced friction (no manual editing required)
- ‚úÖ Guided conversation ensures complete information

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Generate a new project
copier copy . my-project

# Copier prompts:
# Project purpose: A SaaS platform for customer support with AI ticket routing
# Primary domains: ticketing,users,ai-suggestions
# Tech stack summary: Redis, Temporal, OpenAI, SendGrid

# 2. Generated .github/copilot-instructions.md contains:
# "You are assisting with a SaaS platform for customer support with AI ticket
# routing. This application follows hexagonal architecture with domain-driven
# design, organized around bounded contexts: ticketing, users, ai-suggestions.
# The technology stack includes next (frontend), fastapi (backend), postgresql
# (database), and Redis, Temporal, OpenAI, SendGrid."

# 3. Six months later, project evolves...
# Developer in VS Code:
@workspace .github/prompts/project.describe-context.prompt.md

# AI asks questions, developer answers, AI updates the file
```

## Traceability

- **Relates to**: AI_PRD-001 (AI-enhanced workflows in generated projects)
- **Aligns with**: DEV-ADR-002 (Modular instruction stacking)
- **Implements**: User story "As a developer, I want Copilot to understand my project context"

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Add examples** to the prompt showing great vs. poor descriptions
2. **Create a validator** to check context quality (length, specificity)
3. **Track metrics** on how often developers use the refinement prompt
4. **Build a CLI command** `just refine-context` as alternative to chat-based flow
5. **Add context versioning** to track how descriptions evolve over time

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Generate a new project and verify context variables are interpolated
- [ ] Test with minimal inputs (use defaults)
- [ ] Test with full inputs (all custom values)
- [ ] Run the refinement prompt in a generated project
- [ ] Verify markdown linting passes
- [ ] Check that post_gen message displays correctly
- [ ] Validate Jinja2 template syntax
- [ ] Test edge cases (empty strings, special characters)
