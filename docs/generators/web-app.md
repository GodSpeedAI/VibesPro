# web-app generator

This guide documents the `web-app` Nx generator for creating universal React applications (Next.js, Remix, Expo) with shared web assets.

**⚠️ Work in Progress**: This documentation is currently incomplete. The following sections are planned but not yet implemented:

-   Supported frameworks and router styles
-   CLI options and examples
-   Generator outputs and integration with `libs/shared/web`
-   Examples and troubleshooting

**Status**: Documentation will be expanded as the generator implementation stabilizes. Track progress in the [HexDDD universal React generator plan](../plans/hexddd_integration/PHASE-003-UNIVERSAL_REACT_GENERATOR.md).
