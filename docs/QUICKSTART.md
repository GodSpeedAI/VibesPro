# Quick Start Guide: Creating Your First VibesPro Project

**For people who've never used this before!**

## What is This?

VibesPro is a project generator that creates a complete, professional application for you. Think of it like a "create new document" wizard, but instead of a blank page, you get:

- ✅ A fully structured codebase
- ✅ AI-powered development tools
- ✅ Best practices built-in
- ✅ Documentation included
- ✅ Ready to customize and build

## Before You Start

### What You Need

- A computer (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- Basic familiarity with the command line (Terminal/Command Prompt)
- An idea of what you want to build

### Optional: Python dev tools for local validation

If you want to run the repository's type checks and linters locally (recommended for contributors), install the Python dev tools used by this repo:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dev tooling
pip install mypy ruff shellcheck
```

After this, `pnpm run typecheck` will invoke `mypy .` and report issues locally.

### Recommended: Python dev tools (best practice)

For consistent local development and CI parity we recommend creating a per-repo virtual environment and installing the project's checking tools there. This avoids contaminating your global Python environment and ensures everyone runs the same tool versions.

1. Create and activate a virtual environment in the repo root:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Upgrade packaging tools and install the recommended dev tools (mypy will install missing stubs when possible):

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install mypy ruff shellcheck types-requests types-PyYAML types-colorama tiktoken
```

3. Run the workspace typecheck and validation commands:

```bash
pnpm run typecheck   # runs tools/check_mypy.sh -> mypy --install-types --non-interactive .
just ai-validate     # runs pre-commit checks, linters, typecheck and tests
```

Notes:

- The project includes a helper `tools/check_mypy.sh` which prefers `.venv/bin/mypy` when present and falls back to PATH mypy. Using the `.venv` created above ensures consistent results.
- `mypy --install-types` will attempt to fetch type stubs automatically when pip is available in the venv. If network access is restricted, install the listed type packages manually.
- Consider adding `.venv/` to your global `~/.gitignore` or the repo `.gitignore` to avoid checking the venv into source control.

### What You DON'T Need

- Deep programming knowledge
- Understanding of complex architecture
- Experience with all the technologies

**The generator will ask you questions and give you good defaults for everything!**

## Step 1: Run the Generator

Open your terminal and type:

```bash
copier copy gh:GodSpeedAI/VibesPro my-new-project
```

Replace `my-new-project` with whatever folder name you want.

## Step 2: Answer the Questions

The generator will ask you a series of questions. Here's what to expect:

### Basic Information (Easy!)

**"What should we call your project?"**

```
Example: Task Manager Pro
Just type what you want people to call your app!
```

**"What's the technical name for your project?"**

```
We'll suggest one like: task-manager-pro
Press Enter to accept it, or type your own (lowercase with dashes).
```

**"Who's creating this project?"**

```
Example: Jane Smith
Your name or company name.
```

**"What email should we use?"**

```
Example: jane@example.com
This goes in documentation, not for signup.
```

### What Your Project Does

**"What does this project do?"**

```
Example: A task manager that helps small teams organize their work

Explain it like you're telling a friend! 1-2 sentences is perfect.
```

### Technology Choices (Pick What You Know)

**"How should we organize your code?"**

```
Choices:
→ Hexagonal (Recommended - clean and flexible) ← Choose this if unsure!
  Layered (Traditional approach)
  Microservices (Advanced)
```

**"What kind of user interface do you need?"**

```
Choices:
→ Next.js (Websites & web apps - recommended) ← For most people
  Remix (Fast modern websites)
  Expo (Mobile apps for iOS & Android) ← For mobile apps
```

**"What technology should power your backend?"**

```
Choices:
→ FastAPI (Modern & fast - recommended) ← Choose this if unsure!
  Flask (Simple & lightweight)
  Django (Full-featured with admin)
```

**"Where should we store your data?"**

```
Choices:
→ PostgreSQL (Professional - recommended) ← For real projects
  MySQL (Popular & widely supported)
  SQLite (Simple - good for learning) ← For practice/learning
```

**"Include Supabase integration?"**

```
→ Yes ← Gives you auth, real-time data, storage for free!
  No
```

### AI Features (Recommended!)

**"Include AI-assisted development tools?"**

```
→ Yes ← Makes coding easier with smart suggestions!
  No
```

**"Enable AI learning system?"**

```
→ Yes ← AI gets smarter as you work!
  No
```

### Advanced Options (You Can Skip These!)

For the remaining questions:

- If it says "(Advanced)" → **just press Enter to accept the default**
- If you're unsure → **press Enter to accept the default**

**All the defaults are carefully chosen to work great!**

## Step 3: Let It Build!

After you answer the questions:

1. The generator creates your project (takes ~30 seconds)
2. It installs dependencies (might take a few minutes)
3. You'll see a success message!

## Step 4: Open Your New Project

```bash
cd my-new-project
code .
```

(Or open the folder in your favorite editor)

## Step 5: Start Developing!

Your project includes:

### AI-Powered Features

- Open the GitHub Copilot chat
- Select a chat mode (like "Navigator" for general coding help)
- Start asking questions or requesting features!

### Ready-to-Run Commands

```bash
# Start the development server
just dev

# Run tests
just test

# Build for production
just build
```

### Organized Structure

```
your-project/
├── apps/           ← Your user interface code
├── libs/           ← Business logic organized by domain
├── docs/           ← Documentation (already written!)
├── .github/        ← AI chat modes and prompts
└── justfile        ← Easy commands for common tasks
```

## Common Questions

### "What if I pick the wrong option?"

Don't worry! Most choices can be changed later. The important thing is to get started.

### "What if I don't understand a question?"

Look for these clues in the question:

- **(Recommended)** → That's the safe choice
- **"If unsure, choose..."** → Follow that advice
- **"Advanced"** → Just press Enter to skip
- **Examples provided** → Pick something similar to the examples

### "Can I change my answers later?"

Yes! The file `copier.yml` in your project remembers your choices. You can update many things later.

### "What if something goes wrong?"

1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check if you entered a valid email address (must have @)
3. Check if project names don't have spaces or special characters
4. Try again with different answers
