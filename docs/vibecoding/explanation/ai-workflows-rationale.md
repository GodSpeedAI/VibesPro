# Explanation: Why this AI Workflow ðŸ§ 

We prioritize architecture-first, spec-driven development while leveraging Copilot. Chat modes encode TDD/Debug discipline and keep work within CALM + tech stack boundaries.

- Merge-over-add prompts; avoid duplication.
- Namespaced `ai-*` modes and tasks to prevent collisions.
- Context bundle makes Copilot answers architecture-aware.
