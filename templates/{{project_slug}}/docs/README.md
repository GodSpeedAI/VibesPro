# My Project Documentation Hub

Welcome to the documentation workspace generated by VibesPro's HexDDD + VibePDK merger. Every artifact in this directory is produced from Copier templates so that new projects start with production-ready, spec-driven guidance.

## How to use this directory

- `README.md` — Orientation guide (this file).
- `spec_index.md` — Snapshot of product requirements and design references.
- `dev_spec_index.md` — Developer-focused specification overview for tooling and DX work.
- `traceability_matrix.md` — Living record connecting specs to implemented artifacts.
- `commit_message_guidelines.md` — Expectations for traceable, spec-aware commits.
- `how-to/` — Procedure-driven guides for onboarding, AI workflows, and validation.

All documentation embraces the generator-first philosophy: update the template if a guide needs to change so that future projects inherit the improvement automatically.

## AI-enhanced development workflows

VibesPro projects ship with AI-assisted practices by default:

- **Temporal learning** captures architectural decisions and feeds future recommendations.
- **Context-aware prompts** ensure GitHub Copilot and MCP tools respect domain boundaries.
- **Spec enforcement** keeps ADR/PRD/SDS/TS references synchronized through automation.

See `how-to/ai-onboarding.md` for a step-by-step walkthrough of enabling the augmented workflows in a fresh repository, including links back to the traceability matrix and commit message guidelines.

## Quick checklist for maintainers

1. Run `pnpm install` and `pnpm spec:matrix` to regenerate traceability reports.
2. Execute `pnpm prompt:lint` to verify prompt governance before shipping updates.
3. Capture any architectural decision in `docs/architecture/` or via the temporal DB helpers.
4. Keep the AI onboarding guide aligned with your team’s secrets management process.

## Need to extend the docs?

When new patterns emerge, update the template sources under `templates/my-project/docs/` in the generator repository, then regenerate dependent projects. This keeps the ecosystem consistent and traceable across teams.
