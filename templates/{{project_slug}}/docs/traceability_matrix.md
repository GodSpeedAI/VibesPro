# Traceability Matrix

This breadcrumb points to the generated matrix at `docs/specs/traceability_matrix.md`. Run `pnpm spec:matrix` to regenerate it after updating specs or their IDs. Keep commit references aligned with `.github/instructions/commit-msg.instructions.md` so changes remain traceable.
