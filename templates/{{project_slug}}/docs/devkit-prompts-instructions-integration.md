# Devkit → vibePDK: .github prompts, instructions, chat modes, and settings integration

Refs: DEV-PRD-001, DEV-ADR-001, DEV-SDS-001, DEV-TS-001

## Scope and goals

- Integrate devkit’s Copilot guardrails and spec-driven workflows into vibePDK without duplicating or weakening existing guidance.
- Reuse where possible; compose instructions and chat modes rather than copy wholesale.
- Keep security posture: do not auto‑approve tools; avoid modifying VS Code settings automatically.

## Inventory (summary)

- vibePDK
  - `.github/instructions`: context, general, performance, security, style, testing.
  - `.github/prompts`: create-react-component, performance-analysis, security-review.
  - `.github/chatmodes`: rich personas (architect, PM, QA, DevOps, security, etc.).
  - `.vscode/settings.json`: enables instruction/prompt discovery, chat modes, disables autoApprove.
- devkit
  - `.github/instructions`: docs, dev-docs, src, security.
  - `.github/prompts`: spec/traceability workflow (bootstrap, implement/change feature, traceability-matrix, transcript converters, test-hardening, housekeeping).
  - `.github/spec.wide.chatmode.md`, `spec.lean.chatmode.md` (at `.github/` root).
  - `.vscode/settings.json`: explicit codeGeneration.instructions list (golden specs + instruction files), commit message guidance, agent mode enabled.

## Decisions (copy vs compose)

1) Instructions
- Keep vibePDK’s existing instruction set as the base.
- Import devkit’s docs/dev-docs/src/security instructions as additional modules.
- Compose via discovery (no explicit list in settings) with precedence/ordering encoded in instruction texts:
  1. ADR > SDS/Technical Specs > PRD (product) > DEV-* specs > general/style/perf/testing.
- Avoid editing `.vscode/settings.json` directly (security policy). If explicit ordering is later required, gate it behind a manual settings change in a separate PR.

2) Prompts
- Bring in devkit prompts that add clear value:
  - bootstrap-dev-platform, implement-feature, change-feature, traceability-matrix, test-hardening, transcript-to-spec, transcript-to-devspec, spec-housekeeping, generate-ai-docs, load-spec-items.
- Normalize frontmatter/title and budgets; keep prompts small and token-efficient.

3) Chat modes
- Add `spec.wide.chatmode.md` and `spec.lean.chatmode.md` into vibePDK’s `.github/chatmodes/`.
- Keep existing personas; spec-driven modes become “how to work” overlays rather than replacing personas.

4) Settings
- Do not auto-modify `.vscode/settings.json`.
- Add a new repository instruction file for commit messages (see below) to convey commit guidance without touching settings.
- Keep `chat.tools.autoApprove=false`.

## Step-by-step plan

1. [x] Instructions import and de-dup
- Copy devkit instruction files into `vibePDK/.github/instructions/` with names preserved:
  - `docs.instructions.md`, `dev-docs.instructions.md`, `src.instructions.md`, `security.instructions.md`.
- Adjust links to vibePDK’s docs (PRD/ADR/SDS/TS and DEV-* counterparts). If a doc is missing, add a short “Spec Gaps” note in the instruction file with resolution options.
- Keep vibePDK’s `security.instructions.md` as canonical; merge any non-overlapping guidance from devkit’s security file and add a pointer to the canonical one.

2. [x] Copilot instructions merge
- Merge high-value devkit guidance into `vibePDK/.github/copilot-instructions.md`:
  - Spec-first behavior and traceability references (PRD-xxx, ADR-xxx, SDS-xxx, TS-xxx, DEV-* IDs).
  - Optional MCP section already present: align naming and environment variable requirements (no secrets in code).
  - Cross-link to the new commit message instruction file.

3. [x] New commit message instruction
- Add `.github/instructions/commit-msg.instructions.md` covering:
  - Include spec IDs when applicable; summarize change, rationale, risk/mitigations.
  - Keep <72 char subject, wrap body at ~72‑100 cols; use imperative mood.
  - Aligns with existing Husky `commit-msg` hook that requires a spec ID.

4. [x] Prompts
- Copy selected devkit prompts to `vibePDK/.github/prompts/`.
- Ensure each prompt passes prompt lint and budget plan (token estimate).
- Add minimal README lines at the top of each prompt explaining when to use.

5. [x] Chat modes
- Move devkit chat mode files into `vibePDK/.github/chatmodes/`.
- Verify discovery in chat: titles, constraints, and references to instruction files.
- Add a short NOTE in each mode about budget discipline and tool safety.

6. Validation and guardrails
- [x] Pre-commit: prompt lint + plan already wired; ensure new files conform.
- [ ] CI: spec-guard workflow runs matrix/link/lint/plan/tests; ensure links updated.
- [ ] Run a smoke test: use `prompt_lifecycle` CLI with “implement-feature.prompt.md”, confirm transcript logging and matrix updates.

## Enhancements (assumed approved)

- Add `commit-msg.instructions.md` and a brief `docs/commit_message_guidelines.md` for humans; cross-link from README.
- Add a “Onboarding” chat mode to help new contributors discover spec files, guardrails, and lifecycle commands.
- Budget tiers: annotate prompts with level (S/M/L) and include a “max tokens” policy line.
- Optional scheduled housekeeping: run `spec-housekeeping.prompt.md` weekly (documented only; no scheduler committed).

## Risks and mitigations

- Conflicting security guidance: designate `vibePDK/.github/instructions/security.instructions.md` as canonical; merge others carefully.
- Settings drift: keep minimal settings; document optional explicit instruction lists if teams need hard ordering.
- Token bloat: enforce prompt lint/plan budgets; reject large prompts in CI.

## Rollout & rollback

- Rollout in a single PR with clear commit messages referencing DEV-* IDs.
- If needed, rollback by removing imported prompts/chat modes and reverting merged instruction sections; no settings changes means low blast radius.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Instructions: devkit docs/dev-docs/src/security integrated, links valid, no duplication; commit-msg instruction added.
- [x] Chat modes: spec-driven and spec-driven-lean present and discoverable.
- [x] Prompts: selected devkit prompts added and pass lint/plan checks.
- [ ] CI/Guardrails: existing pipelines pass with new content.
- [ ] Documentation: commit message guide present; README points to prompts/modes.
