# Traceability Matrix

> **🎯 Purpose**: Map specifications to implementation artifacts and track coverage status.
> 
> **📝 How to use this file**:
> 1. After implementing features, update this matrix
> 2. Run `just spec-matrix` to auto-generate/validate entries
> 3. Use this as the single source of truth for requirement coverage
> 4. Review regularly to ensure all specs are implemented

## Matrix Structure

| Spec ID | Artifacts | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SPEC-XXX | path/to/file.ts<br>path/to/test.spec.ts | implemented | Brief note |

**Status values**:
- `planned` - Spec exists, not yet implemented
- `in-progress` - Implementation started
- `implemented` - Code complete, tests passing
- `referenced` - Referenced in docs/code
- `validated` - Reviewed and validated
- `deprecated` - No longer applicable

## Example Entries

| Spec ID | Artifacts | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PRD-001 | libs/auth/domain/user.ts<br>libs/auth/infrastructure/oauth-adapter.ts<br>tests/auth/oauth.test.ts | implemented | OAuth2 with Google/GitHub |
| ADR-001 | tsconfig.json<br>all *.ts files | implemented | Strict mode enabled globally |
| SDS-001 | libs/auth/<br>apps/api/src/routes/auth.ts | implemented | Hexagonal auth service |
| TS-001 | libs/core/middleware/rate-limit.ts<br>tests/integration/rate-limit.test.ts | implemented | Redis-based rate limiting |
| PRD-002 | apps/web/src/pages/dashboard.tsx | in-progress | Analytics dashboard WIP |
| ADR-003 | libs/*/infrastructure/ | planned | Database migration strategy |

## Maintenance

- **Auto-generation**: Run `just spec-matrix` to scan codebase and update matrix
- **Manual updates**: Update status and notes as implementation progresses
- **Review cadence**: Check weekly during active development
- **Coverage target**: Aim for 100% spec-to-artifact mapping
- **Keep notes concise**: ≤140 characters for scanability
