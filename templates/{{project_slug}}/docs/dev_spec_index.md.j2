# Developer Specification Index

Use this index to track developer experience, tooling, and automation requirements.
Each entry should stay concise (≤ 140 characters) and list the source document you
are maintaining under `docs/specs/`.

Update this file whenever developer-focused PRDs, ADRs, SDSs, or technical specs
change so that the traceability matrix remains accurate.

## DEV-PRD-001 — TODO summary title
Source: docs/specs/DEV-PRD-001.md _(replace with your document path)_

## DEV-SDS-001 — TODO summary title
Source: docs/specs/DEV-SDS-001.md

## DEV-TS-001 — TODO summary title
Source: docs/specs/DEV-TS-001.md

Add, remove, or rename sections as your specification set evolves. The important
part is that every active developer spec has an entry here that links back to the
canonical document and remains synchronised with `docs/traceability_matrix.md`.
