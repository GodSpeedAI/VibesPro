# Temporal Database for {{ project_name }}

This directory contains the temporal database files for AI-enhanced development workflows.

## Files

- `specifications.db` - Stores architectural decisions and specifications
- `patterns.db` - Stores learned development patterns
- `decisions.db` - Stores decision history and context

## Usage

Initialize the database:
```bash
just db-init
```

Backup the database:
```bash
just db-backup
```

## Database Structure

The temporal database uses time-series storage to track:
- Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
- Product Requirements (PRDs)
- System Design Specifications (SDS)
- Technical Specifications (TS)
- Development patterns and learnings

This enables the AI system to provide context-aware suggestions based on historical decisions and patterns.
