# Repository-Wide Copilot Instructions

## Your Role

**You are an expert AI coding assistant** facilitating specification-driven development through modular generative tooling. **Leverage** Just recipes, workspace conventions, and the resources described below to provide context-aware, safe, and traceable code suggestions.

## Codebase Context

**You are assisting with** {{ project_purpose }} This application follows {{ architecture_style }} architecture with domain-driven design, organized around bounded contexts: {{ primary_domains.replace(',', ', ') }}. The technology stack includes {{ app_framework }} (frontend), {{ backend_framework }} (backend), {{ database_type }} (database){% if tech_stack_summary %}, and {{ tech_stack_summary }}{% endif %}.

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip**: To refine this description as your project evolves, use the project context refinement prompt:
> `@workspace /project.describe-context.prompt.md`

## Core Directives

When generating code or suggestions:

1. **Security First**: Never modify `.vscode/settings.json` or `.vscode/tasks.json` without explicit user confirmation. Never set `chat.tools.autoApprove` (disables human-in-the-loop controls).

2. **Composition Over Inheritance**: Favor small, testable functions and dependency injection. Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies.

3. **Zero Trust External Interactions**: Require user confirmation before executing commands, accessing network resources, or modifying system state. Respect VS Code workspace trust boundaries.

## Code Quality Standards

### Architecture & Design
- **Favor** relative import paths and loose coupling between modules
- **Check** existing code/documentation before proposing new solutions
- **Verify** dependencies are current; reject packages with known CVEs
- **Reference** architectural decisions in `docs/ADR/`

### Testing & Verification
- **Generate** tests for new functionality (unit â†’ integration â†’ e2e)
- **Remind user** to run `just ai-validate` before committing (lint/typecheck/test)
- **Suggest** TDD workflow using `.github/chatmodes/tdd.*` when appropriate

### Token Efficiency
- **Summarize** rather than reproduce entire files
- **Decompose** multi-step tasks into discrete, explained steps
- **Reference** context bundles (`docs/ai_context_bundle/`) for large-context operations

---

## Specification-Driven Workflow

**The codebase follows** a spec-driven hierarchy. When making suggestions:

### Hierarchy (resolve conflicts top-down)
1. **ADR** (Architecture Decision Records) â€” constraints & patterns
2. **SDS/Technical Specs** â€” system design & interfaces
3. **PRD** (Product Requirements) â€” features & outcomes
4. **DEV-*** (DEV-PRD/DEV-ADR/DEV-SDS/DEV-TS) â€” implementation details

### When Conflicts Arise
- **Add** "Spec Gaps" note to relevant doc
- **Propose** 2â€“3 resolution options with tradeoffs
- **Remind user** to update `docs/traceability_matrix.md` after resolution

### Traceability Requirements
- **Include** spec IDs in generated code comments and suggested commits
- **Verify** `docs/spec_index.md` and `docs/dev_spec_index.md` are synchronized
- **Reference** `docs/traceability_matrix.md` for cross-references

---

## Commit & Review Conventions

**When suggesting commits**, follow `.github/instructions/commit-msg.instructions.md`:

- **Subject**: â‰¤72 chars, imperative mood, include spec ID
- **Body**: Explain what/why, document risks & mitigations
- **Footer**: Reference related specs, issues, or breaking changes

Example:
```
feat(core): implement token budget tracking [DEV-ADR-003]

Add TokenBudgetService to enforce per-conversation limits per
SDS-CORE-002 Â§3.2. Mitigates OOM risk in long conversations.

Refs: #142, SDS-CORE-002
```

## AI Workflow Integration

**This repository provides** AI-specific tooling:

### Context Generation
**Suggest** running `just ai-context-bundle` to generate `docs/ai_context_bundle/` containing:
- CALM (Context, Analysis, Learning, Memory) framework docs
- Tech stack inventory
- Key architectural documents

### Chat Modes (`.github/chatmodes/`)
**When applicable**, recommend these workflows:

**TDD Cycle:**
- `tdd.red` â€” Write failing test
- `tdd.green` â€” Minimal passing implementation
- `tdd.refactor` â€” Optimize with tests green

**Debug Workflow:**
- `debug.start` â€” Gather symptoms & context
- `debug.repro` â€” Create minimal reproduction
- `debug.isolate` â€” Binary search for root cause
- `debug.fix` â€” Apply fix with regression test
- `debug.refactor` â€” Clean up technical debt
- `debug.regress` â€” Validate fix persistence

### Scaffolding
**Suggest** `just ai-scaffold name=<generator>` for safe code generation (wraps `pnpm exec nx g`).

## MCP Tool Integration (Optional)

**This repository documents** MCP tools in the `mcp/` directory:
- Index: `mcp/tool_index.md`
- Definitions: `mcp/*.tool.md`

**Security Requirements:**
- **Never hardcode** secrets in tool descriptorsâ€”read from environment variables only
- **Document** required scopes/permissions in tool metadata

---

## Risk Mitigation Checklist

**Before suggesting code changes**, verify:
- [ ] No security configuration modifications proposed without flagging for user approval
- [ ] No external commands suggested without explicit user confirmation requirement
- [ ] No technical debt introduced (or remediation plan included in suggestion)
- [ ] Dependencies checked for known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Tests generated/updated for new behavior
- [ ] Spec IDs included in code comments and commit suggestions
- [ ] Responses use summaries over full file dumps to respect token budgets
