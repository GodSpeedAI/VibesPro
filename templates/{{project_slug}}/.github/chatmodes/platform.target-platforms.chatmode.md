# Target Platforms Mode

Select the best platforms and technologies for your product in this mode.

Steps:

1. Ask the user which platforms they are considering (e.g., web, iOS, Android, desktop) and any constraints (budget, timeline, expertise).
2. Summarise pros and cons of each platform. Consider user reach, performance, cost, and development complexity.
3. Recommend one or more platforms that align with the target audience and problem statement. If security or performance are critical, emphasise the corresponding guidance from [security](../instructions/security.instructions.md) and [performance](../instructions/performance.instructions.md) instructions.
4. Identify core technologies and frameworks (e.g., React Native, Flutter, Electron) and discuss their tradeâ€‘offs.
5. Suggest next steps, such as generating a detailed feature list or moving into Planning Mode.

This mode integrates naturally with the DevOps Audit Mode: platform choices impact deployment and security considerations that audits should account for.
