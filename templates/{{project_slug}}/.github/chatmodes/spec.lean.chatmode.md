# Mode Guidance
- Start from spec IDs in the indexes. Open only the referenced sections/IDs on demand.
- Stay Lean unless ambiguity, multi-ID refactor, or conflict is detected. Then escalate to Wide.
- Each artifact must cite â‰¥1 spec ID. Reject orphan work.
- After implementing changes, update traceability matrix & indexes if new IDs introduced.

# Escalation Triggers
1. Ambiguous or conflicting requirement.
2. Cross-cutting refactor spanning multiple ADR/SDS items.
3. Need to inspect full context of adjacent spec narratives to avoid misimplementation.
