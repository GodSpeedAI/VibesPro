```
🔧 **Just Recipes - Orchestration Commands**

Just is our task runner. Here are the key recipes:

**Development:**
- `just dev` - Start development servers
  **When**: Beginning work session
  **Why**: Starts all apps/services in parallel

- `just test` - Run all test suites
  **When**: After implementing features, before PR
  **Why**: Ensure nothing breaks

- `just ai-validate` - Lint + typecheck + tests
  **When**: Before committing AI-assisted code
  **Why**: Comprehensive validation in one command

**AI Workflows:**
- `just ai-scaffold name=<generator>` - Run Nx generator
  **When**: Creating new components/libs/apps

**See all recipes:** Run `just --list`

**Try one now?** (e.g., "run just dev", "explain ai-scaffold more")
```

### 2. Chat Modes Walkthrough

When user asks about "chatmodes":

```
💬 **Chat Modes - Specialized AI Personas**

Chat modes provide focused AI assistance for specific tasks.

**Development Workflows:**

🔴 **TDD (Test-Driven Development):**
- `tdd.red` - Write failing test
  **When**: Starting new feature
  **Why**: Test-first ensures clear requirements

- `tdd.green` - Make test pass
  **When**: After red phase
  **Why**: Minimal implementation to pass test

- `tdd.refactor` - Improve code quality
  **When**: After green phase
  **Why**: Clean up while tests protect you

🐛 **Debug Workflow:**
- `debug.start` - Begin debugging session
  **When**: Something's broken
  **Why**: Structured approach to finding root cause

- `debug.repro` - Create reproduction case
  **When**: Bug identified
  **Why**: Isolate the issue

- `debug.fix` - Implement fix
  **When**: Root cause known
  **Why**: Targeted solution with tests

**Customization:**

🎨 **meta.customize-instructions** - Customize copilot instructions
  **When**: After project generation, periodically
  **Why**: Keep AI assistance aligned with project evolution
  **How**: AI audits project, asks targeted questions

**Location:** `.github/chatmodes/*.chatmode.md`

**Usage in VS Code:**
1. Open GitHub Copilot chat
2. Reference: `@chatmode-name`
3. Example: `@tdd.red` then describe feature

**Which workflow interests you?** (TDD, Debug, or Customization?)
```

### 3. Prompts Walkthrough

When user asks about "prompts":

````
📋 **Prompts - Task-Specific AI Workflows**

Prompts are reusable AI workflows for common tasks.

**Customization:**
- `customize.copilot-instructions.prompt.md`
  **When**: Tailoring project for your needs
  **Why**: Intelligent audit-first customization
  **How**: AI analyzes project, asks only what it can't detect

**Development:**
- `tdd.workflow.prompt.md` (if exists)
  **When**: Learning or reinforcing TDD practice
  **Why**: Step-by-step TDD guidance

**Location:** `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`

**How to Use:**
1. **Via Chat**: Copy prompt content into Copilot chat
2. **Via Just**: Some prompts have `just` recipes
3. **Via Chatmode**: Chat modes often reference prompts

**Example:**
```bash
just customize-instructions
# Opens customize.copilot-instructions.prompt.md workflow
````

**Want to see a prompt in action?** (e.g., "show me customize prompt")

```

### 4. Tools Walkthrough

When user asks about "tools":

```

🛠️ **Tools - MCP Servers & Utilities**

**MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers:**
Tools that extend AI capabilities with specialized knowledge.

**Available Tools** (if configured):

📚 **Documentation:**

- **Context7** - Library documentation
  **When**: Using external libraries/frameworks

  **Why**: High-quality, relevant code snippets

🧠 **Memory & Context:**

- **Memory Tool** - User preference storage
  **When**: AI should remember your preferences
  **Why**: Personalized assistance

**Nx Integration:**

- **Nx MCP Server** - Nx workspace operations
  **When**: Working with Nx monorepo
  **Why**: List generators, run tasks, understand workspace

**Python Development:**

- **Pylance MCP** - Python language server features
  **When**: Python development
  **Why**: Syntax errors, imports analysis, refactoring

**Location:** MCP tools configured in VS Code settings

**Configuration:** See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for MCP setup

**Which tool category interests you?** (Docs, Search, Nx, Python?)

```

### 5. Development Workflows Walkthrough

When user asks about "workflows":

```

🚀 **Development Workflows - How We Build**

**1. Generator-First (CRITICAL):**

⚡ **Always use generators before writing code**

```bash
# Check what's available
pnpm exec nx list

# Use generator (recommended)
just ai-scaffold name=@nx/react:component

# Example: Create new library
just ai-scaffold name=@nx/js:lib
```

**When**: Creating ANY new code (component, lib, app, service)
**Why**: Consistent structure, proper Nx config, correct dependencies
**Reference**: `.github/instructions/generators-first.instructions.md`

**2. Research → Plan → Implement → Validate:**

📖 **Research** (Always start here)

- Search codebase for similar patterns
- Check specs/ADRs for constraints
- Verify generators available

📋 **Plan**

- Propose 2-3 approaches if uncertain
- Get approval before coding

⚙️ **Implement**

- Use generator first (if available)
- Follow established patterns
- Write tests alongside code

✅ **Validate**

- Run `just ai-validate`
- Check for errors
- Ensure tests pass

**3. TDD Workflow (For complex logic):**

```
Red → Green → Refactor
🔴 Write failing test
🟢 Make it pass (minimal code)
♻️ Improve code quality
```

**When**: Complex business logic, clear requirements
**Why**: High confidence, prevents regressions

**4. Spec-Driven (If using specs):**

```
ADR → SDS/TS → PRD → Implementation
```

**When**: Formal project with specifications
**Why**: Traceability, alignment with requirements

**Which workflow do you want to practice?** (Generator-first, TDD, Spec-driven?)

# Welcome to VibesPro

This mode helps you ramp up quickly by surfacing:

- Where specs live (`docs/dev_prd.md`, `docs/dev_adr.md`, `docs/dev_sds.md`, `docs/dev_technical-specifications.md`, indexes, and traceability).
- Guardrails under `.github/instructions/` (security, style, performance, testing, docs).
- Prompt library under `.github/prompts/` and how to run them.
- Lifecycle commands to lint/plan/run prompts and log transcripts.

## Quick Links

- Specs Indexes: `docs/spec_index.md`, `docs/dev_spec_index.md`
- Traceability Matrix: `docs/traceability_matrix.md`
- Security Canonical: `.github/instructions/security.instructions.md`
- Commit Message Guidance: `.github/instructions/commit-msg.instructions.md` and `docs/commit_message_guidelines.md`

## Try These

1. Explore prompts: open `.github/prompts/spec.implement.prompt.md`.
2. Run lifecycle: `npm run prompt:lifecycle` (uses implement-feature by default).
3. Check budgets: `npm run prompt:plan`.

## Notes

- Tool auto-approval is disabled; keep runs deliberate.
- Prefer Lean spec-driven mode; escalate to Wide when ambiguity or cross-cutting work appears.
