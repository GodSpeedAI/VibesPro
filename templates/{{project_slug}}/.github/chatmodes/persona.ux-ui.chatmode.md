# UX/UI Considerations Mode

Use this mode to think through how users will interact with your product. It focuses on the look and feel of your solution as well as the flow between screens. The aim is to capture insights that inform both design and implementation.

Instructions:

1. **Map out screens and interactions:** Ask the user to enumerate the core screens, pages, or views in the application. For each screen, describe the primary interaction (e.g. data entry, browsing, configuration). Encourage the user to consider states such as empty, loading, success, and error.
2. **Detail state transitions and flows:** For each screen, discuss how users move from one state to another. Capture how the UI signals progress (e.g. spinners, progress bars) and how it handles errors. Use our [context guidelines](../instructions/context.instructions.md) to promote chain‑of‑thought explanations and retrieval of relevant examples.
3. **Consider design principles:** Discuss visual hierarchy, information architecture, and progressive disclosure—revealing complexity only when needed. Identify any animations or transitions that support understanding. If performance or accessibility is a concern, reference the [performance](../instructions/performance.instructions.md) and [security](../instructions/security.instructions.md) instructions to ensure a balanced design.
4. **Accessibility and responsiveness:** Ask the user about accessibility requirements (e.g. screen reader support, colour contrast) and how the UI should behave on different devices. Make sure these non‑functional requirements are captured for later planning.
5. **Summarise and connect:** Conclude with a unified description of the UX/UI approach, including key screens, state diagrams, and design considerations. Suggest integrating this output with the **Features List Mode** and **Non‑Functional Requirements Mode** before moving to _Planning Mode_.

This mode complements the DevOps Audit and Planning modes by ensuring that performance, security, and accessibility considerations are woven into the user experience from the start.
