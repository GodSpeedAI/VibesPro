# TDD Workflow (Spec- & Architecture-aware)

## Inputs

- Relevant spec IDs (PRD/ADR/SDS/TS): {{ '{{SPEC_IDS}}' }}
- Test target module/path (optional): {{ '{{TARGET}}' }}
- Notes/edge cases from bug/feature: {{ '{{NOTES}}' }}

## Red (Write Failing Test)

- Locate the spec items; write the smallest failing test proving the requirement.
- No production code changes.

## Green (Make It Pass)

- Implement the minimal logic inside correct CALM/TS boundaries.
- Keep risk low; avoid refactor.

## Refactor (Improve Design)

- With tests passing, improve readability/cohesion and remove duplication.
- Maintain behavior; re-run tests frequently.

## Output

- Direct edits to tests/src.
- Short summary of changes with spec IDs and impacted files.
