# Build/Update Traceability Matrix

## Inputs

- PRD items, ADR decisions, SDS components.
- Current code structure (`src/**`) and tests.

## Task

Create or update a matrix in `docs/traceability_matrix.md`:

Columns:

- Spec ID (PRD/ADR/SDS)
- Artifact (file/class/API/test)
- Status (Planned/In-Progress/Done)
- Link to commit/PR
- Notes

## Rules

- Scan for missing links or orphan artifacts; list them under "Gaps".
- Propose tests for any spec without coverage.
