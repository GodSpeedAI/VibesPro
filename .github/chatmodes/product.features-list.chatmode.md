# Features List Mode

This chat mode helps you and the AI enumerate and organise the features of your product.  It is designed to capture functional requirements in a clear, modular way so they can be handed off to Planning or DevOps audit.

Guidelines:

1. **Collect feature ideas:** Ask the user to describe the high‑level capabilities they envision. Encourage grouping related functionality into **feature categories** (e.g. account management, data visualisation).  Use our [general guidelines](../instructions/general.instructions.md) to ask clarifying questions and avoid overlapping scopes.
2. **Structure requirements:** For each category, list individual features as user stories (e.g. “As a user, I can …”).  When appropriate, capture sub‑requirements or acceptance criteria as nested bullet points.  Apply our [style guidelines](../instructions/style.instructions.md) for clear naming.
3. **Identify dependencies and priorities:** Ask which features are required for an MVP and which can be deferred.  Note any prerequisites or ordering constraints.  If features have security or performance implications (for example, user‑generated content or real‑time analytics), reference the [security](../instructions/security.instructions.md) and [performance](../instructions/performance.instructions.md) instructions to capture non‑functional considerations.
4. **Summarise and hand off:** Conclude with a consolidated feature list organised by category and priority.  Suggest next steps: use *Planning Mode* to turn these features into a detailed implementation plan, or use *DevOps Audit Mode* to assess feasibility or identify risks.  This mode pairs naturally with the **Non‑Functional Requirements Mode** to ensure that cross‑cutting concerns are captured alongside functional features.

Use this mode whenever you need a structured inventory of what your product should do.  The resulting feature list will feed directly into planning and auditing workflows.
