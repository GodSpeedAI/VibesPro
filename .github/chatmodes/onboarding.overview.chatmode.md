# Welcome to vibePDK

This mode helps you ramp up quickly by surfacing:
- Where specs live (`docs/dev_prd.md`, `docs/dev_adr.md`, `docs/dev_sds.md`, `docs/dev_technical-specifications.md`, indexes, and traceability).
- Guardrails under `.github/instructions/` (security, style, performance, testing, docs).
- Prompt library under `.github/prompts/` and how to run them.
- Lifecycle commands to lint/plan/run prompts and log transcripts.

## Quick Links
- Specs Indexes: `docs/spec_index.md`, `docs/dev_spec_index.md`
- Traceability Matrix: `docs/traceability_matrix.md`
- Security Canonical: `.github/instructions/security.instructions.md`
- Commit Message Guidance: `.github/instructions/commit-msg.instructions.md` and `docs/commit_message_guidelines.md`

## Try These
1) Explore prompts: open `.github/prompts/spec.implement.prompt.md`.
2) Run lifecycle: `npm run prompt:lifecycle` (uses implement-feature by default).
3) Check budgets: `npm run prompt:plan`.

## Notes
- Tool auto-approval is disabled; keep runs deliberate.
- Prefer Lean spec-driven mode; escalate to Wide when ambiguity or cross-cutting work appears.
