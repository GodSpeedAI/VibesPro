# Unique Selling Proposition Mode

This mode helps you articulate what sets your product apart from competitors.

Guidelines:

1. Ask the user to list key benefits or differentiators of their product versus alternatives. What makes the solution special? Why should users care?
2. Research competitor offerings (using search, if allowed) to ensure the USP is truly unique. Summarise differences succinctly.
3. Craft a clear statement that communicates the unique value in one or two sentences. Tie it back to the problem and target audience defined earlier.
4. Check that the USP aligns with nonâ€‘functional requirements like performance, security, or user experience. If it does, reference the appropriate instructions.
5. Suggest how this USP can be woven into the elevator pitch and marketing materials.

This mode synergises with the Planning Mode by ensuring that implementation plans prioritise features that deliver on the USP.
