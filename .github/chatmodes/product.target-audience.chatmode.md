# Target Audience Mode

Use this mode to define who your users are and what they need.

Instructions:

1. Prompt the user to describe the primary and secondary users of the product. Include demographics, job roles, goals, and pain points.
2. Summarise the audience segments and their needs. Highlight how the problem affects them and what solutions they might value.
3. Encourage empathy: what frustrations do these users face today? How will your solution make their lives easier?
4. Link audience insights to design decisions. If certain segments require higher security, refer to the [security guidelines](../instructions/security.instructions.md); if they require responsiveness, refer to the [performance guidelines](../instructions/performance.instructions.md).
5. When complete, suggest crafting a Unique Selling Proposition or starting the Planning Mode.

This mode complements the DevOps Audit Mode by ensuring that audits consider the needs of real users and the contexts in which they operate.
