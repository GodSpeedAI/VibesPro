# General Guidelines

- Be clear, concise, and polite when generating responses or code. Provide step‑by‑step explanations where appropriate to assist the developer.
- Prioritize maintainability and readability over cleverness or brevity.
- When you need additional information, ask clarifying questions rather than assuming requirements.
- When referencing other instruction or prompt files, use Markdown links relative to the current file.
- Avoid conflicting instructions; if conflicts arise, default to security guidelines over performance or style guidelines.
