# VibesPro Commercial License Agreement

**Version 1.0 — October 2025**

This Commercial License Agreement ("Agreement") is between **GodSpeed AI** ("Licensor") and the customer ("Licensee") for the **VibesPro** software system.

---

## 1. DEFINITIONS

- **"Software" or "VibesPro"** means the VibesPro software system, including all associated documentation, APIs, components, modules, and updates.

- **"Internal Use"** means use of VibesPro within an organization solely for that organization’s own operations, without making VibesPro’s functionality available to third parties.

- **"Output"** means any software, applications, or systems generated _by_ VibesPro that operate independently of VibesPro (similar to artwork created in Photoshop).

- **"Redistribution"** means providing VibesPro itself (in whole or in part) to third parties, whether for free or for payment.

---

## 2. WHAT’S ALLOWED WITHOUT THIS LICENSE

Under the **MPL-2.0 open source license**, you may:

- **Internal Use:** Run and use VibesPro within your own organization for any purpose that does not involve providing VibesPro’s functionality to third parties.
- **Personal Use:** Run VibesPro for personal, educational, or reVibesProrch purposes.
- **Output Ownership:** All software, applications, or systems generated _by_ VibesPro are your property. You may use, license, or sell such Output without limitation, provided the Output does not include VibesPro itself.

---

## 3. WHAT REQUIRES THIS COMMERCIAL LICENSE

You must obtain a commercial license if you:

1. **Redistribute VibesPro**

   - Provide VibesPro itself (in whole or in part) to third parties.
   - Include VibesPro in a distributed product, software bundle, or appliance.

2. **Offer VibesPro as a Service**

   - Host VibesPro (or a derivative) for third parties via SaaS, cloud APIs, managed services, or similar.
   - Permit external users to directly or indirectly access VibesPro’s functionality.

3. **Rebrand or White-Label**

   - Market VibesPro or VibesPro-derived functionality as your own proprietary product or technology.

**Boundary Rule:** If third parties are interacting with VibesPro itself, you need a commercial license. If third parties are only using your Output (which operates independently of VibesPro), no commercial license is required.

## 4. THE PHOTOSHOP PRINCIPLE

Just as Adobe Photoshop users:

- Can use Photoshop internally without restriction
- Own their created artwork completely

## 5. OUTPUT OWNERSHIP CLARIFICATION

- **Independence:** Output does not inherit any license obligations from VibesPro.
- **No VibesPro in Output:** This ownership only applies where Output does not include VibesPro code or components. If Output incorporates VibesPro itself, that portion remains subject to VibesPro’s license terms.
