## 🎯 What If Building Software Didn't Require Learning to Code?

**The gap between idea and implementation is artificial.**

Today, transforming a business concept into working software requires translating your vision through developers, waiting for sprints, and hoping nothing gets lost in translation. By the time you see results, requirements have changed.

**What if you could describe what you need—and the system built it?**

VibesPro is a **Cognitive Infrastructure Development Environment** that understands your domain, remembers your decisions, and grows with your organization. You describe the business logic. The environment handles the rest.

## ⚡ What VibesPro Enables

### For Domain Experts & Product Teams

- **Describe, Don't Code** — Express business requirements in natural language; AI translates them into validated, tested implementations
- **See Results Immediately** — Changes materialize in minutes, not sprints
- **Your Knowledge Becomes The System** — Every decision is captured and compounds over time
- **Consistency Guaranteed** — Patterns established once apply everywhere automatically

### For Your Organization

- **Living Documentation** — Specifications, decisions, and patterns stay synchronized with the actual system
- **Institutional Memory** — Query what worked, what failed, and why before making decisions
- **Infinite Scalability** — New patterns spawn new capabilities; the environment evolves with you
- **Quality By Default** — Every generated component is tested, documented, and validated

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start (3 Commands)

```bash
# 1. Create your environment
copier copy gh:GodSpeedAI/VibesPro my-project

# 2. Initialize
cd my-project && just setup

# 3. Start building
just dev
```

> 💡 **Note:** VibesPro synthesizes a complete development environment tailored to your project. Don't clone the repository—use Copier to generate your personalized environment.

### What Happens Next

Once your environment is running, you interact with it conversationally:

1. **Describe what you need**: "I need to track customer orders with status updates and notifications"
2. **Review the proposal**: The AI drafts specifications and a plan
3. **Approve and generate**: The system scaffolds the implementation
4. **Validate and iterate**: Review generated tests and refine as needed

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### The Three Layers

**1. Intelligence Layer — Your AI Development Team**

Specialized assistants understand different aspects of building software:

- **Architect** — Designs scalable patterns
- **Product Specialist** — Translates requirements into specifications
- **Quality Guardian** — Ensures everything is tested and validated
- **Security Analyst** — Identifies risks before they become problems

**2. Memory Layer — Organizational Knowledge**

Everything learned becomes organizational capital:

- Architectural decisions and their rationale
- Patterns that worked (and those that didn't)
- Domain-specific conventions and rules
- Temporal evolution of your systems

**3. Generation Layer — Pattern-to-Code**

Proven patterns automatically become reusable capabilities:

- Describe a pattern once; apply it everywhere
- New patterns spawn new generators automatically
- Consistency enforced at the infrastructure level

**4. Traceability Layer — Decision to Implementation**

Complete audit trail from concept to running code:

- **ADR → Spec → Generator → Code → Test** — Every artifact links to its origin
- **Constrained AI** — AI doesn't invent code; it selects from validated patterns
- **Schema-enforced outputs** — All generation validated against contracts
- **Immutable decision history** — Query what was decided, when, and why

## 📊 What You Can Expect

| Traditional Approach                  | With VibesPro                          |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Weeks of developer setup              | Ready in minutes                       |
| Requirements lost in translation      | Direct domain expression               |
| Knowledge locked in developers' heads | Institutional memory compounds         |
| Inconsistent implementations          | Patterns enforced automatically        |
| "Works on my machine" chaos           | Reproducible everywhere                |
| Technical debt from day one           | Best practices embedded from the start |

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

### Today

- **Product Managers** who want to prototype and iterate without waiting for developer availability
- **Domain Experts** who understand the business but not the code
- **Technical Leaders** who want to encode organizational knowledge
- **Development Teams** who want to eliminate boilerplate and focus on business logic
- **Compliance Officers** who need complete audit trails from decision to deployment

### For Regulated Industries

VibesPro provides **end-to-end traceability** that compliance teams require:

| Requirement     | How VibesPro Delivers                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Audit trail     | Every code artifact links to its originating decision (ADR/PRD/SDS)                                   |
| Change control  | All modifications flow through validated generators, not manual edits                                 |
| Reproducibility | Same inputs produce identical outputs; environments are deterministic                                 |
| AI governance   | **Constrained AI generation** — AI operates within validated boundaries, not arbitrary code invention |
| Evidence        | Traceability matrix auto-generated; specifications stay synchronized with implementation              |

### Tomorrow

VibesPro is building toward a future where the question isn't _"how do I code this?"_ but _"what should this do?"_—and the system handles the rest.

## 📜 License

VibesPro is distributed under the MPL-2.0 for most use cases, which enforces a file-level copyleft: any modified MPL-covered file (or file that includes MPLed content) must remain under the MPL, and you must make the source or modifications to those files available when you distribute or deploy them. The MPL obligations are triggered per-file, so you can still combine MPLed code with other licenses as long as the MPL files stay open.

A commercial license is required if you want to re-license VibesPro itself or embed it inside a closed-source product or service without exposing the MPL-covered files.

See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the full legal text, and consult legal counsel if you need certainty about your release or deployment plans.
