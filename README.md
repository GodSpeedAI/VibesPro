## 📋 Important: Template vs. Generated Project

**VibesPro is a Copier template, not a standalone application.**

- 🎨 **This repository** contains the template that generates projects
- 🏗️ **You work in** the projects that VibesPro generates for you
- 🚀 **Quick start:** `copier copy gh:GodSpeedAI/VibesPro my-project`

Think of VibesPro as a **cookie cutter** 🍪—you don't work inside the cookie cutter, you use it to create cookies (projects) that you then customize and enjoy!

---

## 🎬 Picture This...

It's Monday morning. Your team just got greenlit to build a new service. You know the business logic inside and out, but the thought of setting up *yet another* codebase makes you weary. Copy-pasting from the last project? Risky. Starting from scratch? Days of boilerplate await.

**What if, instead, you could describe what you need and have a perfectly structured, production-ready application appear—architecture solid, tests included, documentation written—all in the time it takes to grab a coffee?**

That's VibesPro.

---

## 🚀 The Simple Truth

**VibesPro is like having an expert architect sitting beside you**, one who:

- **Remembers every decision** your team has made (and why)
- **Speaks your language** (TypeScript, Python, Rust—pick your flavor)
- **Never forgets best practices** (hexagonal architecture, domain-driven design, type safety)
- **Gets smarter over time** (learning from your patterns and preferences)

Think of it as a **GPS for software architecture**—you tell it where you want to go, and it creates the clearest path there, avoiding potholes and dead ends.

---

## ✨ How It Works (The Human Way)

### Step 1: **Generate Your Project from the Template**
```bash
copier copy gh:GodSpeedAI/VibesPro my-project-name
# Answer a few friendly questions about your project
```

Imagine ordering a custom coffee: "I'd like a web API with user authentication, using TypeScript and PostgreSQL." VibesPro captures your vision, just like that barista who remembers your usual order.

### Step 2: **Watch Your Project Take Shape**
```bash
cd my-project-name
just setup
# Minutes later, not days...
```

Behind the scenes, intelligent templates assemble your application like an expert chef preparing a dish—each layer (interface, business logic, database) perfectly placed, nothing missing, nothing extra.

**What you get:**
- 📂 A complete, organized workspace (think: a well-organized kitchen, not a junk drawer)
- ✅ Tests already written (your safety net is built-in)
- 📚 Documentation that actually explains things (imagine instructions that make sense)
- 🔐 Security baked in, not bolted on later
- 🛠️ **Complete development setup** – Nx, TypeScript, ESLint, Jest all configured and working
- 🎯 **Zero manual configuration** – Run `pnpm install` and start coding immediately
- 🔄 **Production-ready from day one** – Build, lint, and test targets work out of the box

### Step 3: **Start Building What Matters**
```bash
pnpm dev
# Your app is running. Really.
```

No configuration hell. No "works on my machine" surprises. Just clean, working code ready for your unique ideas.

---

## 🧠 The Secret Ingredient: Memory That Matters

Here's where VibesPro becomes truly different.

Every project you create teaches it something. Made a decision about how to handle authentication? Chose a specific pattern for error handling? **VibesPro remembers**—and suggests those same smart choices next time.

It's like muscle memory for your entire team. New developer joins? They inherit the wisdom of every project that came before, automatically.

**Powered by temporal intelligence:**
- 🕰️ Tracks decisions across time
- 🎯 Suggests patterns that worked before
- 🔄 Improves recommendations with each project
- 💾 Stores knowledge locally (your insights stay yours)

---

## 🎯 What This Means For You

### Instead of Days, Think Minutes
- **Before:** Week one: setup, configurations, folder structure, testing framework...
- **After:** Hour one: writing actual business logic

### Instead of Chaos, Think Clarity
- **Before:** Every project looks different; new dev needs a week to understand the layout
- **After:** Consistent architecture across all projects; new dev productive on day one

### Instead of Debt, Think Foundation
- **Before:** Technical debt accumulates from day one (cutting corners to ship faster)
- **After:** Best practices embedded from the start; you're building on solid ground

---

## 🏗️ Under the Hood (Without the Jargon)

Think of your application like a **modern building**:

**🏛️ Interface Layer** (The Lobby)
- Where users and systems enter
- Web pages, API endpoints, command-line tools
- First impression matters; this layer makes it welcoming

**🎯 Application Layer** (The Concierge)
- Coordinates everything
- Routes requests to the right place
- Handles the "what happens when" logic

**💎 Domain Layer** (The Vault)
- Your business rules and logic
- The crown jewels that make your app unique
- Protected, pure, and portable

**🔌 Infrastructure Layer** (The Utilities)
- Databases, external services, technical plumbing
- Swappable and upgradeable without touching business logic

---

## 🚦 Get Started in Three Commands

```bash
# 1. Generate your project from the VibesPro template
copier copy gh:GodSpeedAI/VibesPro my-awesome-project

# 2. Set up the generated project's environment
cd my-awesome-project && just setup

# 3. See it in action (really, it's ready)
pnpm dev
```

**That's it.** You're building.

> 💡 **Note:** Don't clone the VibesPro repository to work from it directly. VibesPro is a **template** that generates new projects. You use Copier to create a project FROM this template, then work in that generated project.

## 🛠️ Essential Commands (Your Daily Tools)

| What You Want | What You Type | What Happens |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Generate a new project** | `copier copy gh:GodSpeedAI/VibesPro my-project` | Creates a new project from the template |
| **Set up generated project** | `cd my-project && just setup` | Installs all tools and dependencies in your new project |
| **Check quality before pushing** | `just spec-guard` | Runs all validators—like spell-check for architecture |
| **Test the template** | `just test-generation` | Makes sure generated projects actually work (for contributors) |
| **Run all tests** | `pnpm nx run-many --target=test` | Confidence that nothing broke |

> 📝 **For Template Contributors:** If you're developing VibesPro itself, clone this repo and run `just setup` to set up the development environment. Most users should use Copier to generate projects instead.

---

## 📖 The Story of Quality

We don't just generate code—we generate *confidence*.

**Every template goes through:**
- ✅ **Type safety checks** (TypeScript, Python, Rust—all verified)
- ✅ **Architecture validation** (hexagonal patterns enforced)
- ✅ **Security scanning** (vulnerabilities caught before they ship)
- ✅ **Performance testing** (your app starts fast, stays fast)
- ✅ **Documentation generation** (explanations written for humans)

**The promise:** If VibesPro generates it, it works. Period.

## 🆕 Recent Improvements (v0.1.0 – October 2025)

### Complete Nx & TypeScript Configuration Out of the Box

**The Problem We Solved:**
Early generated projects required manual configuration of Nx, ESLint, Jest, and TypeScript settings. Developers faced daemon crashes, module resolution errors, and missing dependencies that took hours to fix.

**The Solution:**
Generated projects now include **complete, production-ready development infrastructure**:

✅ **Nx Workspace** – Fully configured with proper `namedInputs` (no more daemon crashes!)  
✅ **TypeScript** – Strict mode enabled with zero compilation errors  
✅ **ESLint** – Code quality enforcement with Nx module boundaries  
✅ **Jest** – Complete testing framework with sample tests  
✅ **All Dependencies** – Everything installed: tslib, ts-jest, @nx/jest, @nx/eslint  
✅ **Module Resolution** – Fixed TypeScript bundler/node conflicts  
✅ **Error Handling Patterns** – TypeScript strict mode examples included  

**What This Means:**
```bash
# After generating a project from VibesPro
copier copy gh:GodSpeedAI/VibesPro my-project
cd my-project
pnpm install

# This JUST WORKS (no manual fixes needed):
npx nx build core      ✅ Compiles successfully
npx nx lint core       ✅ All files pass linting  
npx nx test core       ✅ 3 sample tests passing
npx nx show projects   ✅ Projects detected instantly
```

**No more:**
- ❌ "production is an invalid fileset" errors
- ❌ Module resolution conflicts
- ❌ Missing tslib dependency errors
- ❌ Hours of manual configuration
- ❌ Copy-pasting configs from other projects

**Just:**
- ✅ `pnpm install` and start building
- ✅ Complete development workflow ready
- ✅ Professional setup from second one

**Technical Details:**
- Upgraded Nx packages: 19.8.4 → 21.6.4
- Added 10+ development dependencies
- Created 13 configuration files in template
- Fixed TypeScript `moduleResolution` conflicts
- Included proper error handling patterns for strict mode

See: `docs/workdocs/template-nx-fixes-complete.md` for full details.

**Special thanks** to every contributor who believed that building software could feel less like archaeology and more like artistry.

### Understanding Your Rights: The Photoshop Rule 🖼️

We follow what we call **"The Photoshop Rule"** — a simple way to understand how you can use VibesPro without getting lost in legal jargon:

> **Think of VibesPro like Photoshop.**
>
> You can use Photoshop to design, paint, or build anything — logos, posters, full digital worlds. You can sell your art, keep it private, or use it inside your company.
>
> What you *can't* do is **sell Photoshop itself** or offer "Photoshop as a service."

It's the same with VibesPro:

- ✅ **Use VibesPro freely inside your organization** — generate projects, build applications, support your development workflows
- ✅ **Use it to create outputs** (applications, services, codebases) and use or sell those outputs however you like
- ✅ **Modify and customize** templates and generators for your team's needs
- ❌ **Don't resell VibesPro itself** — you can't package it up and offer it as a hosted platform or SaaS to third parties without a commercial license
- ❌ **Don't strip out VibesPro's core** to make a competing generator service

**Dual License Structure:**

- 🧩 **MPL-2.0 (Open Source)** — for personal, educational, and internal company use
- 💼 **Commercial License** — required if you want to embed, resell, or offer VibesPro as a hosted service

**In short:** Build amazing things with VibesPro. Sell what you build. Just don't sell VibesPro itself.

See `LICENSE` for complete legal terms.
