## 📋 Important: Template vs. Generated Project

**VibesPro is a Copier template, not a standalone application.**

-   🎨 **This repository** contains the template that generates projects
-   🏗️ **You work in** the projects that VibesPro generates for you
-   🚀 **Quick start:** `copier copy gh:GodSpeedAI/VibesPro my-project`

Think of VibesPro as a **cookie cutter** 🍪—you don't work inside the cookie cutter, you use it to create cookies (projects) that you then customize and enjoy!

---

## 🎬 Picture This...

It's Monday morning. Your team just got greenlit to build a new service. You know the business logic inside and out, but the thought of setting up _yet another_ codebase makes you weary. Copy-pasting from the last project? Risky. Starting from scratch? Days of boilerplate await.

**What if, instead, you could describe what you need and have a perfectly structured, production-ready application appear—architecture solid, tests included, documentation written—all in the time it takes to grab a coffee?**

That's VibesPro.

---

## 🚀 The Simple Truth

**VibesPro is like having an expert architect sitting beside you**, one who:

-   **Remembers every decision** your team has made (and why)
-   **Speaks your language** (TypeScript, Python, Rust—pick your flavor)
-   **Never forgets best practices** (hexagonal architecture, domain-driven design, type safety)
-   **Gets smarter over time** (learning from your patterns and preferences)

Think of it as a **GPS for software architecture**—you tell it where you want to go, and it creates the clearest path there, avoiding potholes and dead ends.

---

## ✨ How It Works (The Human Way)

### Step 1: **Generate Your Project from the Template**

```bash
copier copy gh:GodSpeedAI/VibesPro my-project-name
# Answer a few friendly questions about your project
```

Imagine ordering a custom coffee: "I'd like a web API with user authentication, using TypeScript and PostgreSQL." VibesPro captures your vision, just like that barista who remembers your usual order.

### Step 2: **Watch Your Project Take Shape**

```bash
cd my-project-name
just setup
# Minutes later, not days...
```

Behind the scenes, intelligent templates assemble your application like an expert chef preparing a dish—each layer (interface, business logic, database) perfectly placed, nothing missing, nothing extra.

**What you get:**

-   📂 A complete, organized workspace (think: a well-organized kitchen, not a junk drawer)
-   ✅ Tests already written (your safety net is built-in)
-   📚 Documentation that actually explains things (imagine instructions that make sense)
-   🔐 Security baked in, not bolted on later
-   🛠️ **Complete development setup** – Nx, TypeScript, ESLint, Jest all configured and working
-   🎯 **Zero manual configuration** – Run `pnpm install` and start coding immediately
-   🔄 **Production-ready from day one** – Build, lint, and test targets work out of the box

### Step 3: **Start Building What Matters**

```bash
pnpm dev
# Your app is running. Really.
```

No configuration hell. No "works on my machine" surprises. Just clean, working code ready for your unique ideas.

---

## 🧠 The Secret Ingredient: Memory That Matters

Here's where VibesPro becomes truly different.

Every project you create teaches it something. Made a decision about how to handle authentication? Chose a specific pattern for error handling? **VibesPro remembers**—and suggests those same smart choices next time.

It's like muscle memory for your entire team. New developer joins? They inherit the wisdom of every project that came before, automatically.

**Powered by temporal intelligence:**

-   🕰️ Tracks decisions across time
-   🎯 Suggests patterns that worked before
-   🔄 Improves recommendations with each project
-   💾 Stores knowledge locally (your insights stay yours)

---

## 🎯 What This Means For You

### Instead of Days, Think Minutes

-   **Before:** Week one: setup, configurations, folder structure, testing framework...
-   **After:** Hour one: writing actual business logic

### Instead of Chaos, Think Clarity

-   **Before:** Every project looks different; new dev needs a week to understand the layout
-   **After:** Consistent architecture across all projects; new dev productive on day one

### Instead of Debt, Think Foundation

-   **Before:** Technical debt accumulates from day one (cutting corners to ship faster)
-   **After:** Best practices embedded from the start; you're building on solid ground

---

## 🏗️ Under the Hood (Without the Jargon)

Think of your application like a **modern building**:

**🏛️ Interface Layer** (The Lobby)

-   Where users and systems enter
-   Web pages, API endpoints, command-line tools
-   First impression matters; this layer makes it welcoming

**🎯 Application Layer** (The Concierge)

-   Coordinates everything
-   Routes requests to the right place
-   Handles the "what happens when" logic

**💎 Domain Layer** (The Vault)

-   Your business rules and logic
-   The crown jewels that make your app unique
-   Protected, pure, and portable

**🔌 Infrastructure Layer** (The Utilities)

-   Databases, external services, technical plumbing
-   Swappable and upgradeable without touching business logic

---

## 🚦 Get Started in Three Commands

```bash
# 1. Generate your project from the VibesPro template
copier copy gh:GodSpeedAI/VibesPro my-awesome-project

# 2. Set up the generated project's environment
cd my-awesome-project && just setup

# 3. See it in action (really, it's ready)
pnpm dev
```

**That's it.** You're building.

> 💡 **Note:** Don't clone the VibesPro repository to work from it directly. VibesPro is a **template** that generates new projects. You use Copier to create a project FROM this template, then work in that generated project.

---

Developer quickstart (venv)

If you're contributing to the template itself (editing files in this repo), we recommend creating a local Python virtual environment (`.venv`) and following the quickstart venv steps in `docs/QUICKSTART.md` (see the "Recommended: Python dev tools" section). After creating the venv, run `pnpm run typecheck` and `just ai-validate` to verify mypy, linters and pre-commit hooks are working locally.

### v0.3.0 – Production-Ready Observability Stack (October 2025)

**The Problem We Solved:**
Modern applications need visibility into performance, errors, and behavior in production. Teams struggled with fragmented logging, missing traces, and no unified view of system health.

**The Solution:**
A **complete observability pipeline** following industry best practices (OpenTelemetry, Vector, OpenObserve):

✅ **Rust-Native Instrumentation** – `vibepro-observe` crate with OpenTelemetry tracing
✅ **Runtime Feature Flags** – Enable/disable telemetry via `VIBEPRO_OBSERVE` environment variable
✅ **Vector Data Pipeline** – OTLP ingestion, transformation, routing, and buffering
✅ **OpenObserve Storage** – Long-term trace and log storage with SQL querying
✅ **Structured Logging** – JSON logs for Node.js (Pino) and Python (Logfire)
✅ **PII Redaction** – Automatic removal of sensitive data in Vector transforms
✅ **Trace Correlation** – Link logs to distributed traces with trace_id/span_id
✅ **Comprehensive Testing** – 8 test suites validate the entire pipeline
✅ **Complete Documentation** – 630+ lines in `docs/observability/README.md`

**What This Means:**

```bash
# Start the observability pipeline
just observe-start

# Enable tracing in your Rust application
export VIBEPRO_OBSERVE=1
cargo run -p my-service

# Run the complete test suite
just observe-test-all
✅ OTLP integration tests passed
✅ Vector smoke test passed
✅ OpenObserve sink test passed
✅ CI observability test passed
✅ Feature flag test passed
```

**Performance:**

-   🚀 **<1µs overhead** per trace span
-   📊 **<3% CPU usage** in Vector at 1k spans/s
-   ⚡ **Zero impact** when `VIBEPRO_OBSERVE=0`
-   🔄 **Async export** – non-blocking trace emission

**Architecture (3 Layers):**

1. **Instrumentation** – Emit structured spans from Rust code via `tracing` crate
2. **Collection** – Vector buffers, samples, redacts, and enriches telemetry
3. **Storage** – OpenObserve indexes and stores for querying and analysis

**Security & Privacy:**

-   🔒 PII redaction removes emails, tokens, and secrets automatically
-   🔐 SOPS-encrypted credentials in `.secrets.env.sops`
-   🎯 Opt-in telemetry (disabled by default)
-   🛡️ Token-based authentication with OpenObserve

**Just Recipes:**

```bash
just observe-start        # Start Vector edge collector
just observe-stop         # Stop Vector gracefully
just observe-logs         # Tail Vector logs
just observe-validate     # Validate Vector config
just observe-test-all     # Run all observability tests
```

**New Components:**

-   `crates/vibepro-observe/` – Rust instrumentation library
-   `apps/observe-smoke/` – Smoke test application
-   `libs/node-logging/` – Node.js structured logging
-   `libs/python/vibepro_logging.py` – Python structured logging
-   `ops/vector/` – Vector configuration and documentation
-   `tests/ops/` – 8 comprehensive test suites

**Technical Specs:**

-   Implemented across 6 TDD phases (DEV-ADR-016, DEV-SDS-017, DEV-PRD-017)
-   OpenTelemetry 0.31.0+ with OTLP/gRPC and HTTP
-   Vector 0.43.0+ with VRL transforms
-   14 work summaries documenting implementation

See: `docs/observability/README.md` for complete setup and operational guides.

✅ **All Dependencies** – Everything installed: tslib, ts-jest, @nx/jest, @nx/eslint
✅ **Module Resolution** – Fixed TypeScript bundler/node conflicts
✅ **Error Handling Patterns** – TypeScript strict mode examples included

**What This Means:**

```bash
# After generating a project from VibesPro
copier copy gh:GodSpeedAI/VibesPro my-project
cd my-project
pnpm install

# This JUST WORKS (no manual fixes needed):
npx nx build core      ✅ Compiles successfully
npx nx lint core       ✅ All files pass linting
npx nx test core       ✅ 3 sample tests passing
npx nx show projects   ✅ Projects detected instantly
```

**No more:**

-   ❌ "production is an invalid fileset" errors
-   ❌ Module resolution conflicts
-   ❌ Missing tslib dependency errors
-   ❌ Hours of manual configuration
-   ❌ Copy-pasting configs from other projects
