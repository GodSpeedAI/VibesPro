## 📖 Quality Assurance Model

We don't synthesize code—we synthesize **certified engineering capability**.

**Every synthesized application undergoes:**

- ✅ **Type safety verification** (TypeScript, Python, Rust—zero tolerance for type errors)
- ✅ **Architecture compliance** (hexagonal patterns enforced at synthesis time)
- ✅ **Security hardening** (vulnerabilities prevented, not patched)
- ✅ **Performance validation** (fast boot, predictable runtime characteristics)
- ✅ **Documentation synthesis** (human-readable explanations generated automatically)

**The contract:** If VibesPro synthesizes it, it's production-ready. Period.

✅ **Structured Logging** – JSON logs for Node.js (Pino) and Python (Logfire)
✅ **PII Redaction** – Automatic removal of sensitive data in Vector transforms
✅ **Trace Correlation** – Link logs to distributed traces with trace_id/span_id
✅ **Comprehensive Testing** – 8 test suites validate the entire pipeline
✅ **Complete Documentation** – 630+ lines in `docs/observability/README.md`

**What This Means:**

```bash
# Start the observability pipeline
just observe-start

# Enable tracing in your Rust application
export VIBEPRO_OBSERVE=1
cargo run -p my-service

# Run the complete test suite
just observe-test-all
✅ OTLP integration tests passed
✅ Vector smoke test passed
✅ OpenObserve sink test passed

1. **Instrumentation** – Emit structured spans from Rust code via `tracing` crate
2. **Collection** – Vector buffers, samples, redacts, and enriches telemetry
3. **Storage** – OpenObserve indexes and stores for querying and analysis

**Security & Privacy:**

- 🔒 PII redaction removes emails, tokens, and secrets automatically
- 🔐 SOPS-encrypted credentials in `.secrets.env.sops`
- 🎯 Opt-in telemetry (disabled by default)
- 🛡️ Token-based authentication with OpenObserve

**Just Recipes:**

```bash
just observe-start        # Start Vector edge collector
just observe-stop         # Stop Vector gracefully
just observe-logs         # Tail Vector logs
just observe-validate     # Validate Vector config
just observe-test-all     # Run all observability tests
```

### Understanding Your Rights: The Photoshop Rule 🖼️

We follow what we call **"The Photoshop Rule"** — a simple way to understand how you can use VibesPro without getting lost in legal jargon:

> **Think of VibesPro like Photoshop.**
>
> You can use Photoshop to design, paint, or build anything — logos, posters, full digital worlds. You can sell your art, keep it private, or use it inside your company.
>
> What you _can't_ do is **sell Photoshop itself** or offer "Photoshop as a service."

It's the same with VibesPro:

- ✅ **Use VibesPro freely inside your organization** — deploy agencies, build applications, support your development operations
- ✅ **Use it to create outputs** (applications, services, codebases) and use or sell those outputs however you like
- ✅ **Modify and customize** synthesis patterns and agent workflows for your team's needs
- ❌ **Don't resell VibesPro itself** — you can't package it up and offer it as a hosted platform or SaaS to third parties without a commercial license
- ❌ **Don't strip out VibesPro's core** to make a competing cognitive infrastructure service

**Dual License Structure:**

- 🧩 **MPL-2.0 (Open Source)** — for personal, educational, and internal company use
- 💼 **Commercial License** — required if you want to embed, resell, or offer VibesPro as a hosted service

**In short:** Build amazing things with VibesPro. Sell what you build. Just don't sell VibesPro itself.
