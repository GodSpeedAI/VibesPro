## AI Implementation Prompt: Enhanced Token Counter with ML-Powered Prompt Optimization

### **Project Overview**

Transform the basic token counter script into an intelligent prompt optimization system that not only provides accurate token counts but also uses machine learning to analyze and improve prompt effectiveness.

### **Core Requirements**

#### **1. Accurate Token Counting**

Implement proper tokenization using established libraries:

```python
# Primary implementation with tiktoken for OpenAI models
import tiktoken

def count_tokens_accurate(text: str, model: str = "gpt-4") -> dict:
    """
    Count tokens using the appropriate tokenizer for the model.
    Returns detailed token statistics including:
    - Total tokens
    - Token distribution by type (words, punctuation, special)
    - Estimated cost based on model pricing
    """
    encoding = tiktoken.encoding_for_model(model)
    tokens = encoding.encode(text)

    return {
        "total_tokens": len(tokens),
        "model": model,
        "estimated_cost": calculate_cost(len(tokens), model),
        "token_ids": tokens,
        "decoded_tokens": [encoding.decode([t]) for t in tokens]
    }
```

#### **2. ML-Powered Prompt Analysis**

Build a machine learning system that learns from prompt patterns:

```python
class PromptOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.feature_extractor = PromptFeatureExtractor()
        self.effectiveness_model = self.load_or_train_model()

    def analyze_prompt(self, prompt: str) -> dict:
        """
        Analyze prompt quality using ML models.
        Returns:
        - Predicted effectiveness score (0-100)
        - Token efficiency rating
        - Complexity analysis
        - Suggestions for improvement
        """
        features = self.feature_extractor.extract(prompt)

        return {
            "effectiveness_score": self.effectiveness_model.predict(features),
            "token_efficiency": self.calculate_efficiency(prompt),
            "complexity_metrics": self.analyze_complexity(prompt),
            "optimization_suggestions": self.generate_suggestions(prompt, features)
        }
```

#### **3. Feature Engineering for Prompts**

Extract meaningful features for ML analysis :

```python
class PromptFeatureExtractor:
    def extract(self, prompt: str) -> dict:
        return {
            # Structural features
            "token_count": count_tokens_accurate(prompt)["total_tokens"],
            "sentence_count": len(sent_tokenize(prompt)),
            "avg_sentence_length": self.avg_sentence_length(prompt),

            # Content features
            "instruction_clarity": self.measure_instruction_clarity(prompt),
            "context_completeness": self.assess_context(prompt),
            "task_specificity": self.evaluate_task_specification(prompt),

            # Advanced features
            "role_definition": self.has_role_definition(prompt),
            "example_count": self.count_examples(prompt),
            "constraint_clarity": self.analyze_constraints(prompt),

            # Linguistic features
            "readability_score": self.calculate_readability(prompt),
            "ambiguity_score": self.detect_ambiguity(prompt),
            "directive_strength": self.measure_directives(prompt)
        }
```

#### **4. Prompt Optimization Engine**

Implement ML-driven optimization strategies :

```python
class PromptEnhancer:
    def optimize_prompt(self, original_prompt: str, optimization_goal: str = "clarity") -> dict:
        """
        Use ML to suggest prompt improvements based on learned patterns.
        Goals: clarity, conciseness, effectiveness, token_efficiency
        """
        # Analyze current prompt
        analysis = self.analyzer.analyze_prompt(original_prompt)

        # Generate variations using learned patterns
        variations = self.generate_variations(original_prompt, optimization_goal)

        # Rank variations by predicted effectiveness
        ranked_variations = self.rank_variations(variations, optimization_goal)

        return {
            "original": original_prompt,
            "optimized": ranked_variations[0],
            "alternatives": ranked_variations[1:4],
            "improvements": self.explain_improvements(original_prompt, ranked_variations[0]),
            "token_savings": self.calculate_token_savings(original_prompt, ranked_variations[0])
        }
```

#### **5. Learning from Feedback**

Implement a feedback loop to continuously improve the ML models :

```python
class FeedbackLearner:
    def collect_feedback(self, prompt: str, response_quality: float, user_satisfaction: float):
        """
        Collect real-world effectiveness data to retrain models.
        Store prompt-response pairs with quality metrics.
        """
        self.feedback_db.store({
            "prompt": prompt,
            "features": self.feature_extractor.extract(prompt),
            "response_quality": response_quality,
            "user_satisfaction": user_satisfaction,
            "timestamp": datetime.now(),
            "model_version": self.model_version
        })

    def retrain_models(self):
        """
        Periodically retrain models with accumulated feedback data.
        """
        if self.feedback_db.size() > self.retrain_threshold:
            new_model = self.train_effectiveness_model(self.feedback_db.get_all())
            if self.validate_improvement(new_model):
                self.deploy_new_model(new_model)
```

#### **6. CLI Integration**

Enhance the bash script to use the ML-powered system:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Enhanced token counter with ML-powered prompt optimization

# ... existing code ...

# Call Python ML system
ANALYSIS_RESULT=$(python -m prompt_optimizer analyze "${PROMPT_FILE}")

# Display enhanced results
echo "[Token Analysis]"
echo "  Accurate token count: $(echo $ANALYSIS_RESULT | jq -r '.token_count')"
echo "  Estimated cost: $(echo $ANALYSIS_RESULT | jq -r '.estimated_cost')"
echo ""
echo "[Prompt Quality Analysis]"
echo "  Effectiveness score: $(echo $ANALYSIS_RESULT | jq -r '.effectiveness_score')/100"
echo "  Token efficiency: $(echo $ANALYSIS_RESULT | jq -r '.token_efficiency')"
echo "  Clarity score: $(echo $ANALYSIS_RESULT | jq -r '.clarity_score')"
echo ""
echo "[Optimization Suggestions]"
echo $ANALYSIS_RESULT | jq -r '.suggestions[]'

# Optional: Generate optimized version
if [[ "${OPTIMIZE:-false}" == "true" ]]; then
    OPTIMIZED=$(python -m prompt_optimizer optimize "${PROMPT_FILE}")
    echo ""
    echo "[Optimized Prompt]"
    echo $OPTIMIZED | jq -r '.optimized'
    echo "Token savings: $(echo $OPTIMIZED | jq -r '.token_savings')"
fi
```

### **Strategic ML Advantages**

3. **Personalization**: Adapt to specific use cases and domains through continuous learning

4. **A/B Testing Framework**: Built-in capability to test prompt variations and measure effectiveness

5. **Knowledge Transfer**: Export learned patterns as prompt templates for team use

### **Implementation Steps**

SPRIME01: remember i'm using sled now, not tsink anymore

GitHub Copilot: I'll update the implementation to use sled instead of tsink for the temporal database. Let me examine the current temporal database setup and then adapt the infrastructure layer accordingly.

Ran `add-memory`
Completed with input: {

}

Read [](file:///home/sprime01/projects/VibesPro/Cargo.toml)

I see you still have tsink in Cargo.toml. Let me update the infrastructure to use sled instead. First, let me check if there are any existing sled implementations or if I need to create the adapter from scratch.

-   **Multi-Format Output**: Human-readable and JSON formats for integration

### 🛠️ **Usage Examples**

```bash
# Generate the prompt optimizer in any project
copier copy /path/to/vibes-pro/templates/tools/prompt-optimizer/ ./my-project

# Use the generated CLI tools
./measure_tokens.sh my_prompt.txt --analyze
./measure_tokens.sh my_prompt.txt --optimize --goal clarity --format json
